### Method 1: Local Installation (Recommended)

Create a dedicated folder for your MCP servers and install there:

```bash
# Create MCP servers directory
mkdir ~/mcp-servers
cd ~/mcp-servers

# Install DollhouseMCP
npm install @dollhousemcp/mcp-server
```

**Configure Claude Desktop:**

Add to your config file:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`  
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dollhousemcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/mcp-servers/node_modules/@dollhousemcp/mcp-server/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

💡 **Pro tip**: Replace `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual home directory path.

---

### Method 2: Always Latest with npx

No installation needed! Configure Claude Desktop to always use the latest version:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dollhousemcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@dollhousemcp/mcp-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

📝 **Note**: The `@latest` tag ensures you always get the newest version. Remove it to use npm's cached version.

---

### Method 3: Global Installation

```bash
# Install globally (may require sudo/admin)
npm install -g @dollhousemcp/mcp-server
```

**Configure Claude Desktop:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dollhousemcp": {
      "command": "dollhousemcp"
    }
  }
}
```

⚠️ **Warning**: Only one version system-wide. Consider local installation for more flexibility.

---

### 🎯 Advanced: Multiple Configurations

Want separate portfolios for different contexts? Create multiple local installations:

```bash
# Personal assistant
mkdir ~/mcp-servers/personal
cd ~/mcp-servers/personal
npm install @dollhousemcp/mcp-server

# Work assistant
mkdir ~/mcp-servers/work
cd ~/mcp-servers/work
npm install @dollhousemcp/mcp-server

# Creative writing
mkdir ~/mcp-servers/creative
cd ~/mcp-servers/creative
npm install @dollhousemcp/mcp-server
```

**Configure each with its own portfolio:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dollhouse-personal": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/YOU/mcp-servers/personal/node_modules/@dollhousemcp/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "DOLLHOUSE_PORTFOLIO_DIR": "/Users/YOU/portfolios/personal"
      }
    },
    "dollhouse-work": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/YOU/mcp-servers/work/node_modules/@dollhousemcp/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "DOLLHOUSE_PORTFOLIO_DIR": "/Users/YOU/portfolios/work"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now you can enable/disable different configurations in Claude Desktop as needed!

---

### ✅ Verify Installation

After configuring and restarting Claude Desktop, test with:

```
list_elements type="personas"
```

You should see your available personas. If not, check the [Troubleshooting](#-troubleshooting) section.

---

### 📁 Default Portfolio Location

By default, your elements are stored in:
- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.dollhouse/portfolio/`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.dollhouse\portfolio\`

Use the `DOLLHOUSE_PORTFOLIO_DIR` environment variable to customize this location.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Once installed, try these commands in Claude:

```bash
# Browse available personas
list_elements type="personas"

# Activate a persona
activate_element name="creative-writer" type="personas"

# Browse the community collection

## 🏷️ Version History

### v1.9.21 - 2025-10-23

**Patch Release**: Memory validation system activation and element formatting
#### ✨ Features
- **Element file formatter script** (#1388, fixes #1387)
  - New `scripts/fix-element-formatting.ts` to reformat blob content elements
  - Fixes 140 element files stored as single-line blobs (unreadable in editors)
  - Intelligently adds newlines before/after markdown headers
  - Formats code blocks and YAML structures properly
  - Dry-run mode for safe testing
  - Average line length detection (>200 chars triggers formatting)

#### 🔧 Fixed
- **Background memory validation startup** (#1389)
  - BackgroundValidator service now starts automatically on server initialization
  - Memory entries with UNTRUSTED status will be automatically validated every 5 minutes
  - Trust levels are now properly updated (VALIDATED, FLAGGED, QUARANTINED)
  - Validation runs server-side with zero token cost

#### 🔄 Changed
- **README version history optimization**
  - Limited version history in README to 1.9.x releases only (21 versions instead of 35)
  - Reduced README size from ~75KB to ~61KB for better readability
  - Complete history remains in CHANGELOG.md (source of truth)
  - Updated `generate-version-history.js` minVersion from 1.6.0 to 1.9.0
- **Added missing v1.9.20 changelog entry to README**
  - Previous README was missing the v1.9.20 MCP Registry Publishing Fix

#### Context
The BackgroundValidator service was fully implemented in Issue #1314 (Phase 1: Background validation for memory security) but was never activated. The `backgroundValidator.start()` method was missing from server initialization, causing all memories to remain UNTRUSTED indefinitely.
This patch release adds proper lifecycle management:
- Import backgroundValidator singleton in server initialization
- Start validation service after resource handlers are set up
- Stop service during server cleanup

#### Impact
- Memory security architecture is now fully operational
- UNTRUSTED memories will be automatically validated
- Trust level updates work correctly
- No performance impact (runs in background outside LLM context)

### v1.9.20 - 2025-10-17

**Fix Release**: MCP Registry Publishing Compatibility
#### 🔧 Fixed
- MCP Registry publishing case sensitivity issue (#XXXX)
  - Corrected `mcpName` field in package.json to match GitHub organization capitalization
  - Changed from `io.github.dollhousemcp/mcp-server` to `io.github.DollhouseMCP/mcp-server`
  - Resolves NPM package validation errors when publishing to MCP Registry
  - Ensures proper namespace permission matching

#### Context
The MCP Registry performs two case-sensitive validations:
1. Permission check against GitHub org name (`io.github.DollhouseMCP/*`)
2. NPM package validation against `mcpName` field in package.json
The initial implementation incorrectly used lowercase for `mcpName`, causing a validation mismatch. This patch release corrects the capitalization to match our GitHub organization name.
