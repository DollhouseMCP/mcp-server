name: Publish to npm

# This workflow publishes the package to npm registry when a release is published.
# Uses npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC) for secure, token-free authentication.
#
# Trusted Publishing Setup Required:
# 1. Go to https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dollhousemcp/mcp-server/access
# 2. Add Trusted Publisher:
#    - Provider: GitHub Actions
#    - Organization: DollhouseMCP
#    - Repository: mcp-server
#    - Workflow: publish-npm.yml
#    - Environment: (leave blank)
