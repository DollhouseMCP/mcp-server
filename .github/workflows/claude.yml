# User Access Controls & Workflow Triggering
# ============================================
# WHO CAN TRIGGER: Only explicitly authorized users can mention @claude:
#   - Currently authorized: mickdarling (repository owner)
#   - Add new users by updating the conditional logic below
#   - Triggers work in: issue comments, PR comments, reviews, issue titles
#
# SECURITY MODEL:
#   - Restricted to authorized users only (not all repository contributors)
#   - Prevents unauthorized API usage and potential security vulnerabilities
#   - Repository owner controls who can trigger Claude workflows
#
# SECURITY NOTES:
#   - Claude has write permissions and can modify repository content
#   - All Claude actions are logged in GitHub Actions history
#   - Unauthorized users will see workflow skipped (not failed)
#
# USAGE GUIDELINES:
#   - Use @claude for code assistance, bug fixes, feature implementation
#   - Be specific in requests for better results
#   - Claude will respond in the same thread where mentioned
