# Next Session: Complete Security Audit Suppression Fix

## Immediate Status Check
```bash
cd /Users/mick/Developer/MCP-Servers/DollhouseMCP
git status  # Should be on branch: fix-security-audit-suppressions
gh pr checks 260  # Check CI status
```

## Priority 1: Fix Test Failures
The suppression tests have several failures that need fixing:

```bash
npm test -- __tests__/unit/security/audit/suppressions.test.ts
```

### Known Test Issues:
1. **Glob patterns starting with `*`** - Fixed in code but tests might need updating
2. **Path resolution** - Windows paths and CI paths not resolving correctly
3. **Performance test** - Taking too long (>2 seconds), needs optimization

### Quick Fix Attempts:
```typescript
// In suppressions.ts, the globToRegex function needs to handle:
// *.json → should match any .json file anywhere
// **/*.json → should match .json in any directory
```

## Priority 2: Fix CI Security Audit (172 findings)

### Debug Why CI Has More Findings:
```bash
# Check what's different in CI
npm run security:audit -- --verbose | grep "__tests__" | head -20
```

### Likely Issues:
1. Test file suppressions not working due to path differences
2. Absolute paths in CI don't match our patterns

### Solution:
Ensure these suppressions work for ALL test patterns:
```typescript
{ rule: '*', file: '__tests__/**/*' }
{ rule: 'OWASP-A01-001', file: '__tests__/**/*' }  // For hardcoded secrets
{ rule: 'CWE-89-001', file: '__tests__/**/*' }     // For SQL patterns
```

## Priority 3: Final PR Polish

### Reviewer Wants:
1. **High-quality code** - Not just working, but excellent
2. **Proper testing** - All edge cases covered
3. **Performance** - Already added caching
4. **Security** - No regex injection vulnerabilities
5. **Maintainability** - Clear, documented code

### Final Checklist:
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] CI security audit passing
- [ ] No CodeQL issues
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Clean commit history

## Key Code Locations

### Files to Focus On:
1. `src/security/audit/config/suppressions.ts` - Main implementation
   - `globToRegex()` function (line ~339)
   - `getRelativePath()` function (line ~399)
   - `shouldSuppress()` function (line ~465)

2. `__tests__/unit/security/audit/suppressions.test.ts` - Test suite
   - Performance test (line ~249)
   - Path resolution tests (line ~34)

3. `src/security/audit/SecurityAuditor.ts` - Integration
   - `filterSuppressions()` method (line ~122)

## Commands for Testing

```bash
# Test suppressions locally
npm run security:audit 2>&1 | grep "Total findings:"
# Should show: Total findings: 32

# Test with verbose to see what's suppressed
npm run security:audit -- --verbose

# Run specific test
npm test -- --testNamePattern="should handle various CI path formats"

# Check if patterns work
node -e "
const { shouldSuppress } = require('./dist/security/audit/config/suppressions.js');
console.log(shouldSuppress('OWASP-A01-001', '__tests__/unit/TokenManager.test.ts'));
"
```

## Context for Reviewer Comments

The reviewer emphasized:
1. "This could be better code"
2. "Let's improve that"
3. "Make this a little higher quality"

This means:
- Don't just fix bugs, improve the architecture
- Add proper error handling everywhere
- Make it performant and scalable
- Ensure it works in ALL environments

## If You Get Stuck

1. Check the PR comments: `gh pr view 260 --comments`
2. Look at the CI logs: Click on failed checks in PR
3. Test in Docker to simulate CI: `docker-compose up test`

Remember: The goal is not just to suppress false positives, but to create a robust, maintainable system that the team can rely on.
