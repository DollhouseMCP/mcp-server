## Test Infrastructure Issues
**AUDIT COMPLETE** - Test Infrastructure Auditor Agent  
**Date**: August 20, 2025, 20:30  
**Critical Issues Found**: 3 High Risk, 2 Medium Risk

### ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

**Primary Issue**: Multiple test patterns creating files directly in production portfolio instead of temporary directories.

### CRITICAL FINDINGS

#### 1. Integration Test Script Using Production Directory (HIGH RISK)
**File**: `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server/test/integration/test-collection-submission.sh`  
**Lines**: 92-118  
**Issue**: Script directly writes test persona files to `$HOME/.dollhouse/portfolio/personas/`
```bash
cat > "$HOME/.dollhouse/portfolio/personas/${TEST_PERSONA_MANUAL}.md" << EOF
# Creates Test-Manual-* and Test-Auto-* files in production
```
**Risk**: HIGH - Directly contaminates production portfolio
**Files Created**: Test-Manual-* and Test-Auto-* patterns found in cleanup data

#### 2. Security Tests Using Deprecated Environment Variable (HIGH RISK)
**Files**: 
- `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server/test/__tests__/security/tests/mcp-tools-security.test.ts:32`
- `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server/test/__tests__/security/download-validation.test.ts:39`
- `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server/test/__tests__/security/framework/SecurityTestFramework.ts` (multiple instances)

**Issue**: Tests set `DOLLHOUSE_PERSONAS_DIR` instead of `DOLLHOUSE_PORTFOLIO_DIR`
```typescript
process.env.DOLLHOUSE_PERSONAS_DIR = path.join(testDir, 'personas');
```
**Risk**: HIGH - If server falls back to default paths, files go to production
**Files Created**: YAMLTest*, YAMLBomb*, TestPersona*, malicious payload files

#### 3. Performance Tests Potential Path Issues (HIGH RISK)
**File**: `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server/test/__tests__/performance/PersonaToolsRemoval.perf.test.ts:50`  
**Issue**: Sets `DOLLHOUSE_PORTFOLIO_DIR` correctly but in temp directory structure that may not isolate properly
**Risk**: MEDIUM - Performance test files found in production (perf-test-* patterns)

#### 4. Missing Cleanup in Test Teardown (MEDIUM RISK)
**Multiple Files**: Various test files
**Issue**: Some tests don't properly clean up created personas/files in afterEach()
**Risk**: MEDIUM - Accumulated test artifacts over time

#### 5. Environment Variable Confusion (MEDIUM RISK)
**Issue**: Mix of `DOLLHOUSE_PERSONAS_DIR` (deprecated) and `DOLLHOUSE_PORTFOLIO_DIR` (current)
**Risk**: MEDIUM - Inconsistent test isolation

### FILE CREATION PATTERNS IDENTIFIED

#### testpersona* Files (353 files removed)
**Source**: Security test framework creating unique test personas
**Pattern**: `TestPersona${Date.now()}${Math.random().toString(36).substring(7)}`
**Location**: SecurityTestFramework.ts:294-295

#### yamltest*/yamlbomb* Files (145 files removed)  
**Source**: YAML injection security tests
**Pattern**: `YAMLTest${Date.now()}${Math.random().toString(36).substring(7)}`
**Pattern**: `YAMLBomb${Date.now()}`
**Location**: SecurityTestFramework.ts:432, 497

#### memory-test*/perf-test* Files (15 files removed)
**Source**: Performance and security validation tests
**Location**: download-validation.test.ts:540,580

#### Malicious Test Files (5 files removed)
**Source**: Security framework command injection tests  
**Patterns**: bin-sh.md, rm-rf.md, python-c-*, nc-e-*, touch-tmp-*
**Location**: SecurityTestFramework.ts malicious payloads

### PROPERLY ISOLATED TESTS
**Good Examples**:
- `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server/test/__tests__/unit/portfolio/PortfolioManager.test.ts` - Properly uses temp directories
- Most unit tests properly set `DOLLHOUSE_PORTFOLIO_DIR` to temp locations

### IMPACT ASSESSMENT
1. **523 test files contaminated production portfolio** (96% of personas directory)
2. **5 malicious security test files** in production environment
3. **Integration tests creating persistent test data** in production
4. **Inconsistent environment variable usage** across test suite
5. **Missing cleanup procedures** in several test files

## Code Changes Required
**RECOMMENDATIONS FROM TEST AUDITOR** - Test Infrastructure Auditor Agent  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Must fix before next test run

### IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED

#### 1. Fix Integration Test Script (CRITICAL PRIORITY)
**File**: `test/integration/test-collection-submission.sh`  
**Current Problem**: Lines 92-118 write directly to production portfolio
**Fix Required**:
```bash
# Replace hardcoded production path:
# OLD: cat > "$HOME/.dollhouse/portfolio/personas/${TEST_PERSONA_MANUAL}.md"
# NEW: Use temporary directory:
TEMP_PORTFOLIO="${TEMP_DIR:-$(mktemp -d)}/test-portfolio"
mkdir -p "$TEMP_PORTFOLIO/personas"
export DOLLHOUSE_PORTFOLIO_DIR="$TEMP_PORTFOLIO"
cat > "$TEMP_PORTFOLIO/personas/${TEST_PERSONA_MANUAL}.md" << EOF
```
**Cleanup**: Add trap to remove temp directory on exit

#### 2. Fix Security Test Environment Variables (CRITICAL PRIORITY)
**Files to Fix**:
- `test/__tests__/security/tests/mcp-tools-security.test.ts:32`
- `test/__tests__/security/download-validation.test.ts:39`
- `test/__tests__/security/framework/SecurityTestFramework.ts` (16+ instances)

**Search & Replace**:
```bash
# Find all instances:
grep -r "DOLLHOUSE_PERSONAS_DIR" test/
# Replace with:
DOLLHOUSE_PORTFOLIO_DIR
```
**Specific Changes**:
```typescript
// OLD: process.env.DOLLHOUSE_PERSONAS_DIR = path.join(testDir, 'personas');
// NEW: process.env.DOLLHOUSE_PORTFOLIO_DIR = testDir;
```

#### 3. Standardize Test Environment Setup (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Create**: `test/helpers/test-environment.ts`
```typescript
export class TestEnvironment {
  static setupIsolatedPortfolio(): string {
    const testDir = path.join(tmpdir(), `mcp-test-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).slice(2)}`);
    process.env.DOLLHOUSE_PORTFOLIO_DIR = testDir;
    return testDir;
  }
  
  static cleanup(testDir: string): Promise<void> {
    delete process.env.DOLLHOUSE_PORTFOLIO_DIR;
    return fs.rm(testDir, { recursive: true, force: true });
  }
}
```

#### 4. Update Test Templates (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Create standard beforeEach/afterEach patterns**:
```typescript
describe('Test Suite', () => {
  let testDir: string;
  const originalEnv = process.env.DOLLHOUSE_PORTFOLIO_DIR;
  
  beforeEach(async () => {
    testDir = TestEnvironment.setupIsolatedPortfolio();
    await fs.mkdir(path.join(testDir, 'personas'), { recursive: true });
  });
  
  afterEach(async () => {
    await TestEnvironment.cleanup(testDir);
    if (originalEnv) {
      process.env.DOLLHOUSE_PORTFOLIO_DIR = originalEnv;
    }
  });
});
```

#### 5. Add Environment Validation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Add to test setup files**:
```typescript
beforeAll(() => {
  // Prevent tests from running against production
  const portfolioDir = process.env.DOLLHOUSE_PORTFOLIO_DIR;
  if (portfolioDir?.includes('.dollhouse/portfolio')) {
    throw new Error('Tests must not run against production portfolio directory');
  }
});
```

#### 6. PowerShell Script Fix (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**File**: `test/integration/test-collection-submission.ps1`
**Apply same temp directory pattern as bash script**

### PREVENTIVE MEASURES

#### 1. Pre-commit Hook
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check for production path usage in tests
if grep -r "\.dollhouse/portfolio" test/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.sh"; then
  echo "ERROR: Test files contain production portfolio paths"
  exit 1
fi
```

#### 2. Jest Configuration Update
**File**: `jest.*.config.cjs`
```javascript
setupFilesAfterEnv: [
  '<rootDir>/test/helpers/environment-guard.ts'
]
```

#### 3. CI/CD Validation
Add step to verify no test files in production portfolio after test runs

### FILES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

**Critical (Fix Before Next Test Run)**:
1. `test/integration/test-collection-submission.sh` - Lines 92-118
2. `test/__tests__/security/tests/mcp-tools-security.test.ts` - Line 32
3. `test/__tests__/security/download-validation.test.ts` - Line 39

**High Priority (Fix This Week)**:
4. `test/__tests__/security/framework/SecurityTestFramework.ts` - 16+ instances
5. All files using `DOLLHOUSE_PERSONAS_DIR` (22 files identified)

**Medium Priority (Fix Next Sprint)**:
6. Add standardized test environment helpers
7. Update all test files to use new patterns
8. Add preventive measures (hooks, guards)

### TESTING THE FIXES
1. Run test suite in isolated environment
2. Verify no files created in `~/.dollhouse/portfolio`
3. Check that tests still pass with temp directories
4. Validate cleanup procedures work correctly
