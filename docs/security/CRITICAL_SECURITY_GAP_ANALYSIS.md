# Critical Security Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL**: The current DollhouseMCP architecture performs ALL security validation on the client side, which can be completely bypassed by modifying the local MCP server code.

## The Problem

### Current State (Vulnerable)
```
User → Local MCP Server → [Local Validation] → GitHub API → Public Repository
         ↑                    ↑
    Can modify          Can bypass
```

### Attack Scenario
```typescript
// Attacker modifies their local PersonaSharer.ts:
async sharePersona(persona: Persona): Promise<ShareResult> {
  // Comment out all security checks
  // this.validateContent(persona);  // BYPASSED
  // this.scanForMalicious(persona); // BYPASSED
  
  // Directly submit malicious content
  return this.submitToGitHub(maliciousPayload);
}
```

## Impact Assessment

### High Risk Scenarios
1. **Malicious Code Injection**
   - Attacker bypasses local validation
   - Injects malicious prompts/code
   - Gets published to public marketplace
   - Affects all users who install

2. **Token Theft**
   - Embedded token-stealing prompts
   - Exfiltration instructions
   - Social engineering attacks

3. **Platform Reputation**
   - One successful attack damages trust
   - Media coverage of security breach
   - User exodus

## Required Architecture (Secure)

```
User → Local MCP → Cloud API Gateway → [Server Validation] → GitHub API → Repository
                        ↑                      ↑
                  Cannot modify          Cannot bypass
```

## Immediate Action Plan

### Week 1: Emergency Measures
1. **Disable Direct GitHub Submission**
   ```typescript
   // Temporary measure in PersonaSharer.ts
   async submitPersona(persona: Persona): Promise<SubmitResult> {
     throw new Error(
       'Direct submission temporarily disabled. ' +
       'Please use manual review process: security@dollhousemcp.com'
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Manual Review Queue**
   - Email-based submission
   - Human review of all content
   - Temporary but secure

### Week 2-3: Build Cloud API
1. **Minimal Viable API**
   ```typescript
   // Simple Express API with validation
   app.post('/api/v1/personas/submit', 
     authenticate,
     rateLimit,
     async (req, res) => {
       const validation = await validateServerSide(req.body);
       if (!validation.passed) {
         return res.status(400).json({ errors: validation.errors });
       }
       
       // Only after validation passes
       const result = await submitToGitHub(req.body);
       return res.json(result);
     }
   );
   ```

2. **Deploy to Cloud**
   - AWS Lambda + API Gateway, or
   - Heroku, or
   - Vercel/Netlify Functions

### Week 4: Migration
1. Update MCP server to use API
2. Require API key for submissions
3. Monitor all submissions
4. Gradual rollout

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Cost of NOT Fixing
- **Reputation**: Irreparable damage from first attack
- **Legal**: Potential liability for distributed malware
- **Users**: Loss of entire user base
- **Time**: Months to recover from incident

### Cost of Fixing
- **Development**: 2-4 weeks
- **Infrastructure**: ~$200-500/month
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing but manageable

## Recommended Immediate Actions

### 1. TODAY: Disable Direct Submission
```typescript
// In PersonaSharer.ts - TEMPORARY PATCH
if (!process.env.DOLLHOUSE_CLOUD_API_ENABLED) {
  logger.error('Direct GitHub submission disabled for security');
  return {
    success: false,
    message: 'Submissions temporarily require manual review. Email: security@dollhousemcp.com'
  };
}
```

### 2. THIS WEEK: Communication
- Update documentation about temporary submission process
- Prepare security advisory (don't mention vulnerability details)
- Plan cloud API development

### 3. NEXT 2 WEEKS: Build API
- Simple validation API
- No fancy features initially
- Just secure the submission path

## Alternative: Delay Launch

If building the API isn't feasible immediately:

1. **Remove submission features entirely**
   - Read-only marketplace
   - No user submissions
   - Launch as "curated collection"

2. **Manual curation only**
   - Team adds personas
   - Community suggests via issues
   - Slow but secure

## Security Principles Violated

1. **Never Trust the Client**
   - Current: Trusts local validation
   - Required: Server validates everything

2. **Defense in Depth**
   - Current: Single layer (client)
   - Required: Multiple layers (client + server + monitoring)

3. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Current: Direct GitHub access
   - Required: Mediated through API

## Conclusion

**This is a CRITICAL security issue that MUST be fixed before public launch.**

Options:
1. **Best**: Build cloud API (2-4 weeks)
2. **Acceptable**: Disable submissions, launch read-only
3. **Unacceptable**: Launch with current architecture

The current architecture is equivalent to having a bank vault where customers can disable the lock from outside. No amount of client-side security can fix this fundamental flaw.

**Recommendation**: Pause launch, build API, then launch securely.
