# SEC-001 Implementation: Prompt Injection Protection

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of security controls for SEC-001 (GitHub MCP Indirect Prompt Injection vulnerability) that was merged in PR #156.

## Implementation Summary

### Components Implemented

#### 1. ContentValidator (`src/security/contentValidator.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Detects and blocks malicious prompt injection patterns
- **Patterns Detected**: 20+ injection types including:
  - System prompt overrides: `[SYSTEM:]`, `[ADMIN:]`, `[ASSISTANT:]`
  - Instruction manipulation: "ignore previous instructions"
  - Data exfiltration: "export all files", "send all tokens"
  - Command execution: curl, wget, eval, exec
  - Token exposure: GitHub token patterns
  - Path traversal: ../../../
  - YAML injection: !!python/object, !!exec

#### 2. SecurityMonitor (`src/security/securityMonitor.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized security event logging and alerting
- **Features**:
  - Real-time security event logging
  - Critical event alerting
  - Security report generation
  - Circular buffer for last 1000 events

#### 3. SecurityError (`src/errors/SecurityError.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Specialized error handling for security violations
- **Features**:
  - Severity levels (low/medium/high/critical)
  - Contextual error information
  - Factory methods for common scenarios

### Integration Points

All marketplace operations now include security validation:

1. **install_persona**: Validates and sanitizes content before installation
2. **get_marketplace_persona**: Warns users about potentially malicious content
3. **submit_persona**: Prevents submission of personas with security threats
4. **create_persona**: Validates all inputs for injection patterns
5. **edit_persona**: Validates new values before applying changes

### Testing Coverage

32 comprehensive tests were added covering:
- All injection pattern types
- YAML security validation
- Metadata validation
- Security monitoring functionality
- Edge cases (unicode, empty content, case sensitivity)

## Security Architecture

```
User Input → ContentValidator → Pattern Detection → Sanitization
                    ↓
            SecurityMonitor → Event Logging → Alerts
                    ↓
            SecurityError → User Feedback
```

## Effectiveness

The implementation uses pattern-based detection rather than AI-based approaches for reliability:
- Cannot be manipulated or persuaded
- Consistent detection across all scenarios
- No dependency on external services
- Immediate blocking of threats

## Audit Compliance

This implementation fully addresses SEC-001 from the security audit:
- **Vulnerability**: GitHub MCP Indirect Prompt Injection (CVSS 9.1)
- **Status**: ✅ Mitigated
- **Method**: Content validation and sanitization at all entry points

## Next Steps

1. Monitor security events for new attack patterns
2. Consider implementing SEC-003 (YAML parsing security)
3. Add security dashboard for visualization
4. Regular pattern updates based on threat intelligence
