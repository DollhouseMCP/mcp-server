# Session Notes Documentation Task

## Mission
Review the conversation history and create comprehensive session notes documenting all work completed, decisions made, and lessons learned during this development session.

## Instructions

1. **Read the full conversation** from the beginning to understand the complete context
2. **Identify the session timeline** - when it started, what was the initial goal
3. **Extract all work completed** with specific evidence (files created, commits made, etc.)
4. **Document key decisions and discussions** that shaped the work
5. **Note problems encountered** and how they were resolved
6. **Create a structured session notes document** following the pattern in existing session notes

## Context to Analyze

You should review the entire conversation to extract:
- What was the initial state/problem?
- What work was planned vs what was actually done?
- What files were created or modified?
- What Git operations were performed?
- What decisions were made and why?
- What issues or challenges arose?
- What was learned?

## Reference Format

Look at existing session notes in `docs/development/` for format examples:
- SESSION_NOTES_2025_09_01_DEMO_GIF_CLAUDE_REVIEW_ISSUE.md
- SESSION_NOTES_2025_08_31_EVENING_HOTFIX_COMPLETION.md
- Other SESSION_NOTES files in that directory

## Required Sections for Your Output

Your session notes should include these standard sections:

### 1. Session Setup for Continuity
CRITICAL - This must be the FIRST section. Include:
- All personas that should be activated (with exact commands)
- Any skills, templates, or agents used
- Context documents to read (CLAUDE.md, previous session notes)
- Current branch and repository state
- Working directory path

Example format:
```markdown
