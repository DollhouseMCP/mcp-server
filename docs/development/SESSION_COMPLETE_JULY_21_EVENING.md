## Key Future Features Documented

### Intelligent Memory Sequencing (#335)
**Problem**: Memories with same timestamp need logical ordering
**Solution**: Content analysis for temporal markers, causal relationships, semantic clustering
**Example**: Meeting notes ordered by logical flow rather than creation time

### RAG Integration (#336) 
**Problem**: Need integration with vector databases for enhanced AI context
**Solution**: Bi-directional sync with Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate, etc.
**Benefit**: Export memories to RAG, import insights from RAG

### Knowledge Graph Integration (#337)
**Problem**: Memories exist in isolation, missing relationship discovery
**Solution**: Graph databases (Neo4j, Redis Graph) for relationship mapping
**Important Note**: Respects that memories CAN exist in isolation, enhances when relationships exist

### Advanced Search Integration (#338)
**Problem**: Basic search lacks enterprise capabilities
**Solution**: Hybrid search combining keyword + semantic + graph traversal
**Target**: Elasticsearch/OpenSearch integration

### Memory Framework Integration (#339)
**Problem**: Missing proven memory algorithms
**Solution**: Integrate Mem0 (26% accuracy gain), MemGPT/Letta, Zep
**Benefit**: Leverage battle-tested memory management patterns

### Multi-Modal Support (#340)
**Problem**: Only text memories supported
**Solution**: Images, audio, video, documents with cross-modal search
**Features**: Transcription, OCR, vision model integration

## Collection Integration Planning

### Issue #345 Scope
- Update DollhouseMCP collection for all element types
- Enhanced MCP tools: `browse_marketplace(elementType)`, `search_marketplace()`, `install_element()`
- Element format specifications for Skills, Templates, Agents, Memories, Ensembles
- **Important**: Directory structure details removed - to be determined during implementation

### Element Types to Support
1. **Skills** - Discrete capabilities (code review, translation, analysis)
2. **Templates** - Reusable structures with variables
3. **Agents** - Autonomous goal-oriented actors  
4. **Memories** - Persistent context storage
5. **Ensembles** - Groups of elements working together

## Current Project State

### Memory Element Status
- âœ… **Complete Implementation** - All core features working
- âœ… **Security Hardened** - XSS, YAML injection, Unicode attack prevention
- âœ… **Comprehensive Testing** - 85 tests covering all scenarios
- âœ… **Future Roadmap** - 10 issues tracking all enhancements
- âœ… **Production Ready** - Merged to main branch

### Next Element Implementation Priority
1. **Agent Element** (Most complex) - Goals, decisions, state persistence
2. **Template Element** (Medium complexity) - Variable substitution, includes
3. **Skill Element** (Medium complexity) - Parameters, proficiency tracking
4. **Ensemble Element** (High complexity) - Element orchestration

## Technical Patterns Established

### Security-First Implementation
- All inputs sanitized with UnicodeValidator + sanitizeInput
- SecurityMonitor logging for all operations
- Path traversal protection
- Memory limits and DoS prevention

### Code Quality Standards
- Comprehensive inline documentation
- Security comments explaining all measures
- Constants extracted to shared files
- Performance optimization patterns

### Testing Excellence
- Security scenarios (XSS, Unicode attacks, injection)
- Edge cases (capacity limits, corrupted data)
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Performance validation

- Issues #341-344: Review feedback items
- Issue #345: Collection integration

## Important Conversations This Session

### Memory Relationship Clarification
**User feedback**: "Memories can potentially exist in isolation... since what we're doing is importing and exporting memories that other people are creating to assist personas... Some memories may simply exist in isolation unrelated to any of the other things."

**Impact**: Updated knowledge graph issue (#337) to clarify this isn't about forcing connections but enhancing discovery when relationships do exist.

### Collection Directory Structure
**User feedback**: Directory structure assumptions were incorrect - need longer discussion about actual collection organization.

**Impact**: Removed all directory structure details from issue #345, will determine during implementation.

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Start Agent Element Implementation** - Most complex element type
   - Goal management systems
   - Eisenhower matrix (importance Ã— urgency)  
   - Risk assessment and decision frameworks
   - State persistence between sessions

### Medium Priority  
2. **Collection Structure Discussion** - Determine actual directory organization
3. **Template Element Planning** - Variable substitution and includes system

### Future Sessions
4. **Skill Element Implementation** - Parameter systems and proficiency tracking
5. **Ensemble Element Implementation** - Element orchestration and conflict resolution

## Context for Agent Element

### Implementation Patterns to Follow
1. **Security First** - Follow Memory element security patterns
2. **Comprehensive Testing** - 15+ tests covering all scenarios
3. **Constants Extraction** - Separate constants file
4. **Inline Documentation** - Explain all security measures
5. **Manager Pattern** - Follow MemoryManager approach

### Agent-Specific Challenges
1. **State Persistence** - More complex than memory entries
2. **Goal Management** - Priority systems and decision frameworks  
3. **Risk Assessment** - Prevent harmful or unintended actions
4. **Resource Management** - Computational limits and timeouts
