## What We Accomplished Today

### Major Achievement: v1.2.0 Release Complete âœ…

1. **Released v1.2.0 on GitHub** with two major security features:
   - Rate limiting for UpdateChecker (#72)
   - GPG signature verification for releases (#73)

2. **Fixed Critical Issues** identified by Claude's review:
   - Division by zero protection in RateLimiter
   - Secure random temp file names in SignatureVerifier  
   - Better production environment detection
   - CI compatibility fixes

3. **Achieved 100% CI Pass Rate**:
   - Fixed git tags missing in CI (PR #128)
   - Fixed Windows path validation issues
   - Fixed test mocking for SignatureVerifier
   - All 309 tests passing on all platforms

4. **Created Comprehensive Documentation**:
   - NPM publish checklist with 20 verification steps
   - Session summary with all technical details
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with current state
   - Context handoff for seamless continuation

## Current State

- **Version**: 1.2.0 (ready for npm)
- **Tests**: 309 passing (was 221)
- **CI**: 100% passing on all platforms
- **Package Size**: 279.3 kB
- **New Features**: Rate limiting, signature verification
- **Security**: All critical issues fixed

## Key PRs from Today

1. **PR #123**: Got Claude's review of v1.2.0 (closed after review)
2. **PR #124**: Fixed critical issues from review (merged)
