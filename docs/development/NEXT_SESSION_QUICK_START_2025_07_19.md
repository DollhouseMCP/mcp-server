# Quick Start for Next Session

## Where We Left Off
✅ PR #280 merged - marketplace → collection refactoring complete
✅ All dates fixed from January → July
✅ 6 follow-up issues created (#281-#286)
✅ On main branch, all tests passing (980 tests)

## Immediate Priorities

### 1. User Impact Mitigation (HIGH)
**Issue #282**: Backward compatibility aliases
```typescript
// Users are currently broken - their tools don't exist anymore!
// Old: browse_marketplace → New: browse_collection
```
This should probably be done FIRST to help existing users.

### 2. Migration Guide (HIGH)
**Issue #284**: Create clear migration documentation
- Users need to know how to update their configs
- Should include examples and common issues

### 3. Quick Commands to Start
```bash
# Check current status
cd /Users/mick/Developer/MCP-Servers/DollhouseMCP
git status
npm test

# View the follow-up issues
gh issue view 282  # Backward compatibility (probably most urgent)
gh issue view 284  # Migration guide

# Start on backward compatibility
git checkout -b feature/backward-compatibility-aliases
```

## Key Things to Remember
1. **Breaking Changes Are Live** - Users can't use old tool names anymore
2. **All Tests Pass** - Don't break the 980 passing tests!
3. **Follow Existing Patterns** - The codebase has good examples to follow

## Technical Context
- Tool registration happens in `ServerSetup.ts`
- Tool definitions are in `src/server/tools/`
- Consider deprecation warnings when implementing aliases

## Success Criteria for Next Session
- [ ] Users can still use old tool names (with deprecation warnings)
- [ ] Migration guide helps users update smoothly
- [ ] No regression in functionality or tests
