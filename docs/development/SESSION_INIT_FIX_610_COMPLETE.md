# Session Complete - Fix #610 Initialization Race Condition

**Date**: August 16, 2025  
**Time**: ~6:00 PM EST  
**Branch**: fix/server-initialization-race-condition  
**PR**: #611 - https://github.com/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server/pull/611  

## What Was Accomplished ✅

Successfully fixed the server initialization race condition that was blocking PR #606 and causing Docker test failures.

### The Problem
- Server constructor had async initialization with `.then()`
- `run()` method connected immediately without waiting
- MCP was ready but portfolio/personas weren't loaded
- Commands would fail or hang

### The Solution
Moved initialization to `run()` method with proper sequencing:
1. Created `completeInitialization()` method for post-init logic
2. Modified constructor to only do basic setup (no async)
3. Modified `run()` to await initialization before connecting

### Code Changes
```typescript
// Before (race condition):
constructor() {
  this.initializePortfolio().then(() => {
    // Async initialization
  });
}

async run() {
  await this.server.connect(transport); // Connected immediately!
}

// After (fixed):
constructor() {
  // Only basic setup, no async
}

async run() {
  await this.initializePortfolio();      // Wait for portfolio
  await this.completeInitialization();    // Complete setup
  await this.server.connect(transport);   // Then connect
}
```

## Testing Results

### Local MCP ✅
```bash
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"1.0.0","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0.0"}},"id":1}' | node dist/index.js 2>/dev/null

# Result: Server responds correctly!
{"result":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{"tools":{}},"serverInfo":{"name":"dollhousemcp","version":"1.0.0"}},"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1}
```

### Test Suite
- 1699/1740 tests passing
- 2 failures in rate limiting tests (unrelated to this fix)

## Files Changed
- `src/index.ts`: Moved initialization logic (lines 157-222)
- Added documentation files for tracking

## Impact

### Immediate
- ✅ PR #611 created and ready for review
- ✅ MCP commands work reliably
- ✅ Server initialization is properly sequenced

### Unblocked Work
- PR #606 (search index) can now proceed
- Docker tests should work normally
- Future refactoring of index.ts documented

## Key Learning

The race condition was a legacy pattern from the personas-only days. When portfolio was added, the initialization became async but the connection pattern wasn't updated. This fix ensures proper sequencing:

**Initialize → Complete → Connect**

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for PR #611 review/merge**
2. **After merge**: PR #606 can rebase on develop
3. **Consider**: Extract initialization logic as part of Issue #512

## Commands for Follow-up

```bash
# Check PR status
gh pr view 611

# After merge, update PR #606
git checkout feature/search-index-implementation
git pull origin develop
git rebase develop
```
