# Session Notes - October 4, 2025 (Morning)

**Date**: October 4, 2025
**Time**: 11:55 AM - 2:00 PM (approximately 2 hours)
**Focus**: Dollhouse Console - Comprehensive planning for meta-level project management system
**Outcome**: ‚úÖ Complete implementation plan created (1,900+ lines)

---

## Session Summary

Created comprehensive implementation plan for **Dollhouse Console**, a new lightweight MCP server and script suite that provides meta-level project management on top of DollhouseMCP's memory system. The console addresses cognitive overload from managing 5+ domains (technical, business, marketing, experimental) by automatically synthesizing session notes and memories into actionable domain dashboards.

**Key Innovation:** Voice-driven narrative interface + automated synthesis = "A more practical version of what a real Jarvis interaction tool would be"

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Problem Definition ‚úÖ

**User Context:**
- Working 6-12 hours/day on DollhouseMCP for 3 months straight
- Managing 13 repositories across 5 major domains
- Reaching cognitive limit: can't hold all project state in head anymore
- Previous tools failed (Trello, Obsidian, GitHub Projects) due to manual maintenance burden

**Core Insight:**
User doesn't need better manual tools - needs **automated synthesis** of documentation already being created (session notes, memories).

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ Detailed session notes (250-450 lines, multiple per day)
- ‚úÖ Dual backup (Markdown + DollhouseMCP memories)
- ‚úÖ Voice-to-text narrative input (speech is primary interface)

**What's Missing:**
- ‚ùå Domain-level overview ("what's the state of the website?")
- ‚ùå Cross-domain prioritization (notes are chronological, not priority-based)
- ‚ùå Visual gestalt view (all context is linear text)
- ‚ùå Prospective task management (idea capture, GitHub integration)

### 2. Architecture Design ‚úÖ

**Three-Layer Model:**

1. **DollhouseMCP Core** (exists) - Element management (personas, skills, memories, etc.)
2. **Dollhouse Console** (building) - Meta-level synthesis and task management
3. **Visualization Layer** (future) - Web dashboard, visual segmentation, interconnectivity

**Key Decision:** Build as **separate lightweight MCP server**, not part of main mcp-server
- Reason: Main server already bloated (41+ tools)
- Benefit: Works across all MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Bolt)
- Context overhead: <5K tokens (vs 15-25K for main server)

**Repository Location:** `tools-internal/dollhouse-console/`
- Start private in tools-internal
- Iterate quickly
- Later: decide commercialization path (open source vs proprietary)

### 3. Domain Structure ‚úÖ

**Five Core Domains:**

1. **technical-server** - mcp-server development (SonarCloud, PRs, releases)
2. **technical-other** - website, collection, experimental, IT infrastructure
3. **business-legal** - Incorporation, IP, investors, fundraising
4. **marketing-content** - YouTube, Reddit, LinkedIn, email, social
5. **research-experimental** - Patent research, experiments (private)

**Domain Memory Format:**
- Snapshot-based versioning (not concatenation)
- New entries prepended to `entries[]` array
- Each entry is complete state (not diff)
- Latest entry (entries[0]) is current state
- History preserved for trend analysis

### 4. Tool Specifications ‚úÖ

**9 Tools Total (5 retrospective + 4 prospective):**

**Retrospective (Synthesis):**
1. `console_get_domain_context` - Get consolidated domain view
2. `console_update_domain` - Update domain from narrative input
3. `console_project_overview` - Cross-domain status dashboard
4. `console_weekly_review` - Synthesize week's work
5. `console_search_memories` - Search across all memories/session notes

**Prospective (Task Management):** ‚ö° Added after user feedback
6. `console_add_task` - Capture ideas/tasks with priority
7. `console_sync_github_issues` - Pull GitHub issues to domains
8. `console_create_github_issue` - Create issues from tasks
9. `console_update_task_priority` - Dynamic reprioritization

**Critical Gap Identified:** Initial plan was too retrospective (status/synthesis only). User correctly identified need for prospective task management (idea capture, GitHub integration, priority setting).

**Tool Design Pattern (Learning from Serena analysis):**
- Comprehensive descriptions (~800 tokens each)
- "When to use" / "When NOT to use" sections
- Clear separation from main MCP server tools (`console_*` prefix)
- Expected output token counts specified

### 5. Implementation Plan Document ‚úÖ

**Created:** `tools-internal/DOLLHOUSE_CONSOLE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

**Size:** ~1,900 lines covering:
- Executive summary
- Problem statement
- Architecture (3 layers)
- Implementation strategy (3 phases)
- Domain structure (5 domains)
- Domain memory format (snapshot-based)
- All 9 tool specifications with schemas
- Repository structure
- Configuration examples (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Gemini)
- Technical implementation details (parsers, aggregators, search)
- Error handling & edge cases
- Context window management
- Success criteria
- Additional considerations (7 sections)
- Open questions
- Related documents

**Phases:**
- **Phase 1:** Scripts (Week 1) - Node scripts callable via Bash
- **Phase 1.5:** Task management (After basic scripts) - Add backlog, idea capture
- **Phase 2:** MCP wrapper (When needed) - For Claude Desktop compatibility
- **Phase 3:** Commercialization (Later) - Decide business model

### 6. User Feedback Integration ‚úÖ

**Iteration 1: Visual Interface**
- **Feedback:** Web dashboard not "out of scope" - actually important
- **User insight:** "A more practical version of what a real Jarvis interaction tool would be"
- **Context:** All devices on Tailscale network = local web server accessible everywhere
- **Visual needs:** Post-it note style cards, interconnectivity lines, well-formatted readable content
- **Updated:** Promoted to Phase 2-3, added specific requirements

**Iteration 2: Domain Descriptions**
- **Feedback:** Descriptions are exemplars, not exhaustive
- **Example:** IT work (email setup) belongs in technical-other but wasn't listed
- **Updated:** Added note and expanded technical-other domain

**Iteration 3: Documentation Structure**
- **Feedback:** Need `docs/` folder for dollhouse-console itself
- **Reason:** Will generate session notes during build, may commercialize later
- **Updated:** Added `docs/{development,architecture,guides}` to repo structure

**Iteration 4: Reference Document Ingestion**
- **Feedback:** Beyond session notes, need to ingest research documents
- **Examples:** Long-term memory architecture analysis, persona management comparisons
- **Updated:** Added section on multi-source document synthesis
- **Phased approach:** Session notes (Phase 1), research docs (Phase 2), unified registry (Phase 3)

**Iteration 5: Memory Consolidation**
- **Feedback:** Concept similar to human dreaming - consolidate memories over time
- **Reference:** Serena memory comparison documents, meta-memories concept
- **Updated:** Added weekly consolidation process with example YAML
- **Benefit:** Reduces memory count, preserves high-value context, easier search

**Iteration 6: GitFlow Guardian & SonarCloud**
- **Feedback:** Apply same git workflow protections as mcp-server
- **Question:** Does SonarCloud work on private repos?
- **Answer:** Yes, with paid plan
- **Updated:** Added setup steps, recommended from day 1

**Iteration 7: Templates & Generated Content**
- **Feedback:** Need both YAML and Markdown templates
- **Question:** Save historical views or always generate fresh?
- **Decision:** Dynamic (domain context) + saved (weekly consolidated, retrospectives)
- **Updated:** Added distinction and rationale

**Iteration 8: Task Management & GitHub Integration** üéØ
- **Feedback:** "This looks more retrospective than prospective"
- **Critical gap:** No way to capture ideas, manage tasks, or integrate with GitHub
- **User need:** "I have an idea, add it to domain X as high priority"
- **Updated:** Added 4 new tools (6-9), backlog schema, auto-mapping strategy, workflow examples
- **Result:** Console now truly bidirectional (read + write)

### 7. Future Vision Clarified ‚úÖ

**LLM Agent Interface:**
- Console becomes interface for task-driven agents
- User views domains ‚Üí selects tasks ‚Üí agent proposes approach ‚Üí user approves ‚Üí agent executes
- Results feed back into domain memories automatically
- Scales user capacity without losing oversight

**Visual Dashboard:**
- Local web server (Tailscale accessible)
- Post-it note style cards per domain
- Interconnectivity visualization
- Well-formatted, readable (accessibility important)

**Memory Consolidation:**
- Weekly synthesis (like human dreaming)
- Extract high-value information from 10+ session notes
- Generate smaller, denser consolidated memory
- Link to source materials
- Easier search, trend analysis

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Repository Location
**Decision:** `tools-internal/dollhouse-console/` (not separate repo yet)

**Rationale:**
- Fast iteration without repo overhead
- Private by default (tools-internal is private)
- Easy to extract later when commercialization path clear

### 2. Implementation Approach
**Decision:** Scripts first, MCP wrapper later

**Rationale:**
- Faster to build and test
- Works immediately with Claude Code/Gemini CLI (via Bash)
- MCP wrapper only needed for Claude Desktop
- Can iterate on logic before committing to MCP protocol

### 3. Domain Memory Format
**Decision:** Snapshot-based versioning (not diffs)

**Rationale:**
- Easier to read (each entry is complete state)
- Simpler to implement (no merge logic)
- Can query "what was state on date X?"
- Trade-off: More redundancy, but YAML is small anyway

### 4. Tool Count & Scope
**Decision:** 9 tools (started with 5, added 4 for task management)

**Rationale:**
- 5 retrospective tools: synthesis, reviews, search
- 4 prospective tools: idea capture, GitHub integration, priority management
- Total context: <5K tokens (vs 15-25K for main server)
- Balanced: comprehensive but not bloated

### 5. GitHub Integration Strategy
**Decision:** Bidirectional sync (console ‚Üî GitHub)

**Rationale:**
- Pull issues into console (sync to domains)
- Create issues from console tasks
- Auto-map by labels and keywords
- Priority mapping (labels ‚Üí P0-P3)
- Maintains single source of truth (GitHub issues) while providing local synthesis

   npm init -y
   npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node
   npm install js-yaml glob
   ```

3. **Create domain memory templates**
   - 5 YAML templates (one per domain)
   - Populate with current state from recent session notes
   - Place in `~/.dollhouse/portfolio/memories/`

4. **Build first script: `get-domain-context.ts`**
   - Memory parser
   - Domain aggregator
   - Output formatter
   - Test with existing memories

## Key Learnings

### 1. Tool Design Philosophy
**Learning:** Comprehensive tool descriptions (800 tokens) with "When to use / NOT to use" prevent LLM confusion

**Source:** Serena analysis research (experimental-server docs)

**Application:** All 9 console tools follow this pattern

### 2. Bidirectional Systems Win
**Learning:** Retrospective-only tools (status, synthesis) miss half the value

**User insight:** "This looks more retrospective than prospective"

**Fix:** Added 4 task management tools for idea capture, priority management, GitHub integration

**Result:** Console becomes active participant in workflow, not passive observer

### 3. Voice-First Design
**Learning:** User's primary interface is speech-to-text narrative, not command-line

**Implication:** Tools must be LLM-callable, not CLI-optimized

**Design pattern:** User talks ‚Üí LLM interprets ‚Üí Tools execute ‚Üí Results synthesized

**Example:** "I just thought of X, add it to domain Y as high priority" works seamlessly

### 4. Visual Accessibility Matters
**Learning:** User has reading disorder - well-formatted visual content > raw text

**Requirement:** Markdown preview mode, post-it note cards, interconnectivity visualization

**Technical solution:** Web dashboard (local server, Tailscale accessible)

**User analogy:** "Like a real Jarvis interaction tool"

### 5. Memory Consolidation Mirrors Cognition
**Learning:** Human-like memory consolidation (weekly synthesis) reduces cognitive load

**Concept:** Read 10+ session notes ‚Üí extract high-value info ‚Üí generate consolidated memory

**Benefit:** Fewer, denser files; easier search; preserves history; matches how humans think

**Research reference:** Serena memory comparison, meta-memories concept

### 6. Start Private, Commercialize Later
**Learning:** Don't commit to licensing/business model before validating it works

**Strategy:** Build in tools-internal (private), iterate fast, decide later

**Options:** Open source (MIT), proprietary (paid tool), hybrid (open core)

**Timeline:** Decide after Phase 1 proves value for founder

## Quotes & Insights

### User Vision
> "A more practical version of what a real Jarvis interaction tool would be"

**Context:** Describing the future vision for console as interface for LLM agents with visual task management and automation.

### Critical Feedback
> "This looks more retrospective than prospective... I didn't see much of capturing ideas, adding tasks, GitHub integration."

**Impact:** Led to adding 4 new tools and backlog schema - transformed console from passive to active system.

### Workflow Preference
> "I prefer, beyond any other interface, a speech-to-text interface that can interpret long form narrative voice communication rather than command structures."

**Implication:** All tools must be LLM-callable via narrative input, not CLI-optimized.

### Visual Needs
> "Having things visually segmented, like post-it notes, is not a bad way of going about it. Having lines of interconnectivity, also not a bad thing."

**Result:** Web dashboard with post-it style cards and relationship visualization moved from "future" to Phase 2-3.
