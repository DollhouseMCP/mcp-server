# Session Notes - Capability Index Resource Injection Experiment

**Date**: October 3, 2025
**Time**: 11:36 AM - 4:30 PM (approximately 5 hours)
**Focus**: Implement and test MCP resources for capability index injection
**Outcome**: ✅ Implementation successful, but discovered client-side limitations

---

## Session Summary

Implemented MCP resources capability to expose the capability index as injectable context for LLMs. Successfully built and tested the feature at the protocol level, but discovered that current MCP clients (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Gemini CLI) do not automatically inject resources into conversation context despite successfully discovering them.

**Key Achievement**: Proved that the capability index can be efficiently exposed via MCP resources, with the summary version consuming only 1,254 tokens (0.6% of 200K context).

---

## What We Built

### 1. Capability Index Resource Handler
**File**: `src/server/resources/CapabilityIndexResource.ts`

- Parses capability-index.yaml from portfolio
- Generates three resource variants:
  - `dollhouse://capability-index/summary` - Metadata + action_triggers (1,254 tokens)
  - `dollhouse://capability-index/full` - Complete index (48,306 tokens)
  - `dollhouse://capability-index/stats` - Size measurements (JSON)
- Implements `listResources()` and `readResource()` handlers
- Includes caching with 60-second TTL

### 2. MCP Resource Protocol Integration
**Files Modified**:
- `src/index.ts` - Added `resources: {}` to server capabilities
- `src/server/ServerSetup.ts` - Added resource request handlers:
  - `ListResourcesRequestSchema` handler
  - `ReadResourceRequestSchema` handler
  - Logs: "MCP resource handlers registered"

### 3. Test Infrastructure
**File**: `test-capability-index-resource.js`

- Measures actual token counts (not estimates)
- Generates statistics for all resource variants
- Provides preview of resource content
- Validates resource generation works correctly

### 4. Claude Desktop Configuration
**File**: `/Users/mick/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

- Added `dollhousemcp-capability-index` server entry
- Points to experimental branch build
- Includes verbose logging for debugging

## Token Measurements (Actual, Not Estimated)

### Summary Version
- **Characters**: 6,675
- **Words**: 646
- **Lines**: 265
- **Tokens**: 1,254
- **% of 200K context**: 0.63%
- **% of 1M context**: 0.125%

### Full Version
- **Characters**: 280,832
- **Words**: 20,311
- **Lines**: 9,363
- **Tokens**: 48,306
- **% of 200K context**: 24.15%
- **% of 500K context**: 9.66%
- **% of 1M context**: 4.83%

### Conclusions from Measurements
- ✅ Summary injection is incredibly lightweight (1.25K tokens)
- ✅ Full injection is viable for 500K+ context models
- ✅ Both are practical for 1M+ context models (like Gemini's 4M)

## Testing Results

### Protocol Level Testing ✅

**Log Evidence**:
```
[2025-10-03T16:08:44.581Z] [INFO] MCP resource handlers registered
Message from server: {"capabilities":{"tools":{},"resources":{}}}
Message from client: {"method":"resources/list","params":{}}
Message from server: {"result":{"resources":[...]}} # All 3 resources returned
```

**Findings**:
- ✅ Server correctly advertises `resources` capability
- ✅ Clients successfully call `resources/list` on connection
- ✅ Server returns all 3 resources with proper URIs and descriptions
- ❌ Clients **never** call `resources/read` to actually use them

### Claude Desktop Testing

**Attempts**:
1. Asked to "list available resources" - Started calling `list_elements` and errored
2. Asked to "read dollhouse://capability-index/summary" - No resource reading capability

**Behavior**:
- Discovers resources via `resources/list`
- No UI to browse or enable resources
- No tool available to read resources
- LLM has no access to resource content

**Conclusion**: Resources exist but are invisible to conversations.

### Claude Code Testing

**Test Command**: "Load the capability index summary, please"

**Actual Behavior**:
- Did NOT call `resources/read`
- Instead manually called 5 different tools:
  1. `get_build_info`
  2. `list_elements(type="personas")`
  3. `list_elements(type="skills")`
  4. `list_elements(type="memories")`
  5. `get_active_elements(type="personas")`
- Synthesized results into a nice summary

**Context Usage**: 89K/200K tokens (44% used), 111K free

**Conclusion**: Claude Code 2.0.5 also doesn't use MCP resources automatically.

### Gemini CLI Research

**Web Search Results** (October 3, 2025):
- GitHub Issue #3816 (filed July 2025): "Gemini CLI mcp client does not support resources or prompts"
- **Current Status**: Only tools supported, resources NOT supported
- **Google Response**: Acknowledged as feature request, no timeline
- **Behavior**: Connects, discovers no tools, disconnects (ignores resources/prompts)

**Conclusion**: Same limitation across all tested MCP clients.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. MCP Resources Implementation is Perfect ✅

**What Works**:
- Protocol implementation follows MCP spec correctly
- Resources are properly registered and discoverable
- URIs are valid and content is generated correctly
- Handlers respond to all protocol requests

**Evidence**: Logs show successful `resources/list` exchanges every time.

### 2. Client Support is Missing Across All Platforms ❌

**Pattern Observed**:
```
Client connects → Server advertises resources
Client calls resources/list → Server returns resources
[CLIENTS STOP HERE]
Client should call resources/read → NEVER HAPPENS
Client should inject into context → NEVER HAPPENS
```

**Affected Clients**:
- Claude Desktop (tested)
- Claude Code 2.0.5 (tested)
- Gemini CLI (confirmed via GitHub issue)

### 3. The Gap is on the Client Side, Not Server Side

**Server Responsibilities** (All ✅):
- Advertise `resources` capability
- Implement `resources/list` handler
- Implement `resources/read` handler
- Return valid resource content

**Client Responsibilities** (All ❌ in current implementations):
- Call `resources/read` for desired resources
- Inject resource content into conversation context
- Provide UI for users to enable/disable resources
- Auto-inject based on configuration

### 4. Resources Are a Newer MCP Feature

MCP protocol phases:
1. **Phase 1**: Tools (fully supported by all clients)
2. **Phase 2**: Resources (spec exists, servers implement, clients lag)
3. **Phase 3**: Prompts (similar state to resources)

**Current State**: We're in the gap between server implementation and client adoption.

## Alternative Approaches Discussed

### Option A: Tool-Based Injection

Create a tool that returns the capability index:

```typescript
{
  name: "get_capability_index",
  description: "Returns the complete capability index for context",
  handler: async () => {
    const resource = new CapabilityIndexResource();
    return await resource.generateFull();
  }
}
```

**Pros**: Works with all current clients today
**Cons**: Requires explicit tool call, not automatic

### Option B: Memory-Based Injection

Create a DollhouseMCP memory containing the capability index summary:
- Mark as "always active" or "auto-load"
- Point to it in CLAUDE.md for automatic loading
- 1.25K token overhead

**Pros**: Works today, integrates with existing memory system
**Cons**: Another memory to manage, may not be as discoverable

### Option C: Enhanced Tool Descriptions (From Research Docs)

Implement Serena-style guidance in tool descriptions:
- Add "when to use" / "when NOT to use" sections
- Include implicit scenario handling
- Reference capability index tools
- ~10K token overhead

**Pros**: Works with all clients, improves tool selection directly
**Cons**: Requires updating all tool descriptions

### Option D: Wait for Client Support

Keep the resource implementation as-is and wait for clients to catch up.

**Pros**: Future-proof, already implemented
**Cons**: Unknown timeline for client support

## Context Window Economics

### For Current Models (200K context)
- Summary: 1,254 tokens = 0.6% (negligible)
- Full: 48,306 tokens = 24% (heavy but viable)

### For Large Models (500K-1M context)
- Summary: 0.1-0.2% (essentially free)
- Full: 5-10% (lightweight)

### For Gemini (4M context)
- Summary: 0.03% (completely negligible)
- Full: 1.2% (essentially free)
- Could inject full index + active personas + multiple memories and still use <5% of context

**Conclusion**: The capability index injection becomes increasingly practical as context windows grow.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Resource URI Scheme

Chosen: `dollhouse://capability-index/{variant}`

**Rationale**:
- Clear namespace separation
- Follows common MCP patterns
- Easy to extend (e.g., `dollhouse://personas/list`)

**Alternative Considered**: `dollhouse-capability-index://summary`
- Rejected: Too verbose, harder to extend

### Caching Strategy

- 60-second TTL on parsed capability index
- Prevents redundant file I/O
- Reasonable balance between freshness and performance

### Error Handling

- Graceful degradation if capability-index.yaml missing
- Detailed error logging
- MCP error codes for protocol compliance

### Security Considerations

- No user input in resource generation
- File path is hardcoded (not user-controlled)
- YAML parsing uses js-yaml (already in use)
- No XSS/injection vectors

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Protocol Support ≠ Client Implementation

Just because a protocol supports a feature doesn't mean clients will use it. Always test end-to-end with actual clients.

### 2. Check the Logs, Not Assumptions

Initially assumed resources might be working. Logs showed the truth: `resources/list` called, but never `resources/read`.

### 3. Current MCP Ecosystem State

- **Tools**: Mature, widely supported
- **Resources**: Spec exists, servers implementing, clients lagging
- **Prompts**: Similar state to resources

### 4. Token Measurements Matter

Real measurements (1,254 tokens) were much better than estimates (2,500-3,500 tokens). Always measure.

### 5. Alternative Paths Forward

When the ideal solution isn't viable yet, having practical alternatives (tool-based, memory-based, enhanced descriptions) keeps progress moving.

## Quotes and Key Moments

### User Insight: Testing Strategy
> "I need you to write up some session notes for this session and then commit those session notes to Dollhouse Memory, please, using Dollhouse MCP tools."

Clear, direct instruction on deliverables.

### User Insight: Client vs Protocol
> "Yeah, just restarting Claude Code isn't necessarily going to do the deed. The instance of dollhouse MCP that Claude Code is using is a particular instance..."

Understanding the distinction between development builds and production deployments.

### User Insight: Gemini's Potential
> "I am working on getting all of this to work with Gemini, which has up to 4 million tokens in its context window... we can simply inject the context of the capability index."

Recognizing that different context window sizes enable different strategies.

### Discovery: Resources Work at Protocol Level
From logs: `Message from client: {"method":"resources/list","params":{}}`

Confirmed that the protocol implementation is correct.

### Discovery: But Clients Don't Use Them
From logs: No `resources/read` calls ever appear, despite successful `resources/list` exchanges.

The gap is on the client side.
