# Workflow Element Development Plan

## Meta-Development Approach

We're using DollhouseMCP agents to build the workflow element type - a powerful demonstration of the platform's capabilities building itself.

## Overview

The workflow element type enables complex multi-step orchestration patterns, allowing users to define, execute, and manage workflows that coordinate multiple elements and actions.

## Architecture Design

### Core Components

```typescript
interface WorkflowElement extends IElement {
  steps: WorkflowStep[];
  triggers: WorkflowTrigger[];
  state: WorkflowState;
  context: WorkflowContext;
}

interface WorkflowStep {
  id: string;
  type: 'element' | 'action' | 'condition' | 'parallel';
  config: StepConfiguration;
  next: string[]; // Next step IDs
  error: string; // Error handler step ID
}
```

### Plugin Implementation

The workflow element will be our first full plugin implementation:

```typescript
class WorkflowPlugin implements IElementTypePlugin {
  type = 'workflow';
  version = '1.0.0';
  manager = new WorkflowManager();
  tools = [
    'create_workflow',
    'execute_workflow',
    'list_workflows',
    'get_workflow_status'
  ];
}
```

## Agent-Driven Development Process

### Agents Involved

1. **Alex Sterling** (Orchestrator)

   - Reviews and refines all outputs
   - Ensures consistency

2. **Technical Architect** (Design)
   - Designs workflow architecture
   - Plans state management
   - Defines integration points

3. **Code Generator** (Implementation)
   - Implements workflow engine
   - Creates step processors
   - Builds state management

4. **Test Writer** (Quality)
   - Creates comprehensive tests
   - Validates edge cases
   - Ensures reliability

### Development Workflow

```yaml

Day 2: Implementation
  Morning:
    - Implement state management
    - Add error handling
    - Create context system
  Afternoon:
    - Add conditional logic
    - Implement parallel execution
    - Test basic workflows

Day 3: Integration & Testing
  Morning:
    - Integrate with element system
    - Connect to MCP tools
    - Test complex workflows
  Afternoon:
    - Write comprehensive tests
    - Document API
    - Create examples
```

## Technical Specifications

### Workflow Definition Language

```yaml
name: deployment-workflow
version: 1.0.0
description: Automated deployment pipeline

triggers:
  - type: manual
  - type: schedule
    cron: "0 2 * * *"

context:
  environment: production
  timeout: 3600

steps:
  - id: prepare
    type: action
    action: git_pull
    next: [test]
    
  - id: test
    type: parallel
    steps:
      - unit_tests
      - integration_tests
    next: [build]
    error: rollback
    
  - id: build
    type: action
    action: docker_build
    next: [deploy]
    
  - id: deploy
    type: element
    element: deployment-agent
    config:
      target: production
    next: [verify]
    
  - id: verify
    type: condition
    condition: health_check
    success: complete
    failure: rollback
    
  - id: rollback
    type: action
    action: restore_previous
    
  - id: complete
    type: action
    action: notify_success
```

### State Management

```typescript
interface WorkflowState {
  status: 'pending' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  currentStep: string;
  startTime: Date;
  endTime?: Date;
  context: Record<string, any>;
  history: StepExecution[];
  errors: WorkflowError[];
}
```

### Error Handling

- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Error handler steps for recovery
- State rollback on critical failures
- Comprehensive error logging

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Support parallel execution
- [ ] Maintain state across sessions

### Performance Requirements

- [ ] Zero critical bugs
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] 10+ example workflows

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Content Publishing Workflow
```yaml
steps:
  - Generate content with AI
  - Review with editor persona
  - Format with template
  - Publish to multiple platforms
  - Track engagement
```

### 2. Development Pipeline
```yaml

  - Analyze issue
  - If complex, escalate to expert agent
  - Generate response
  - Follow up after resolution
```
