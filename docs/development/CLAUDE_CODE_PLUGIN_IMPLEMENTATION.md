# Claude Code Plugin Implementation Plan

**Document Version**: 1.0.0
**Date**: October 9, 2025
**Author**: DollhouseMCP Team
**Target Launch**: Tuesday, October 15, 2025
**Status**: Implementation Ready

---

## Executive Summary

Claude Code announced plugin support today (October 9, 2025), creating an opportunity for DollhouseMCP to be among the first MCP servers with native plugin integration. This plan outlines a pragmatic approach to launch a functional plugin by Tuesday, October 15, 2025.

### Key Objectives

1. **Simplify User Experience**: Replace complex MCP tool calls with intuitive slash commands
2. **Maintain Compatibility**: Plugin enhances but doesn't replace MCP server functionality
3. **Fast Time-to-Market**: Launch within 6 days of announcement
4. **Build in Public**: Open development demonstrating DollhouseMCP's agility

### What We're Building

A thin plugin layer that provides slash commands for common DollhouseMCP operations:
- `/dollhouse enable [element]` - Activate personas, skills, etc.
- `/dollhouse disable [element]` - Deactivate elements
- `/dollhouse status` - Show active elements
- `/dollhouse search [query]` - Find elements in portfolio

## Architecture Overview

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Claude Code CLI                  │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│    DollhouseMCP Plugin (NEW)             │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ Slash Commands                     │  │
│  │ /dollhouse enable → activate_element│  │
│  │ /dollhouse status → get_active     │  │
│  └────────────────────────────────────┘  │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│    DollhouseMCP MCP Server (EXISTING)    │
│    All business logic remains here       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Design Principle**: The plugin is a UX enhancement layer, not a logic layer. All business logic stays in the MCP server.

## Critical Path Analysis

### What's Confirmed vs. Speculative

#### ✅ Confirmed (from official docs)
- Plugins support slash commands, agents, hooks, MCP servers
- Structure: `.claude-plugin/`, `commands/`, `agents/`, `hooks/`
- Distribution via GitHub repositories
- Marketplace configuration with JSON manifests

#### ⚠️ Speculative (from integration document)
- Specific token savings percentages (60-90%)
- Hook implementation details (bash scripts with additionalContext)
- 15K character budget limits
- Auto-clearing of context after messages

#### 🎯 Our Approach
Focus on confirmed features (slash commands) for MVP. Defer speculative features (hooks, context injection) until validated.

```json
{
  "name": "DollhouseMCP Official Plugins",
  "owner": "DollhouseMCP",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "dollhousemcp",
      "description": "Simplified commands for DollhouseMCP elements",

### Command Implementation

#### Example: dollhouse-enable.md
```markdown
---
description: Enable a DollhouseMCP element (persona, skill, template, etc.)
argument-hint: element-name
---

Enable the DollhouseMCP element: {{element_name}}

First, use the search_portfolio tool to find "{{element_name}}" in the portfolio.
If found, use the activate_element tool to enable it.
Confirm activation by showing the element details.
If not found, suggest similar elements using fuzzy matching.
```

## Marketing Strategy

### Launch Message
**"DollhouseMCP Launches Claude Code Plugin - First MCP Server with Native Plugin Support"**

### Key Talking Points
1. First-mover advantage in Claude Code ecosystem
2. Simplifies complex MCP operations to simple commands
3. Open source and community-driven
4. Works with existing DollhouseMCP installations

### Distribution Channels
- GitHub repository and releases
- Twitter/X announcement
- Claude Code community forums
- DollhouseMCP website blog
- Reddit (r/LocalLLaMA, r/ClaudeAI)

---

## Future Enhancements (Post-Launch)

### Phase 2: Hooks (Week 2-3)
- Project detection with `.dollhouse-project.json`
- Auto-loading based on directory context
- Session persistence

### Phase 3: Smart Loading (Week 3-4)
- Capability Index integration
- Context-aware element selection
- Token usage optimization (if hooks support injection)

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 5+)
- Custom agents for specialized tasks
- Team collaboration features
- Analytics and usage tracking

---

## Key Decisions

### What We're NOT Building (Yet)
1. **Complex Hooks**: Until we validate how they actually work
2. **Token Optimization**: Claims need empirical testing
3. **Auto-injection**: Requires hook capabilities we haven't confirmed
4. **Budget Management**: No confirmed character limits

### What We ARE Building
1. **Slash Commands**: Confirmed to work, immediate value
2. **Simple Installation**: Via GitHub marketplace
3. **Clear Documentation**: Focus on user success
4. **Compatibility Layer**: Works with existing MCP server

## Implementation Checklist

### Pre-Development
- [x] Analyze plugin system
- [x] Document implementation plan
- [ ] Create GitHub repository

### Development
- [ ] Plugin structure setup
- [ ] Manifest files
- [ ] Slash commands (4)
- [ ] Documentation

### Testing
- [ ] Local marketplace testing

- [ ] Social media ready
- [ ] Support monitoring

---

## Competitive Analysis

### Our Advantages
1. **First MCP server with plugin**: Market leadership
2. **Existing user base**: Immediate adoption potential
3. **Capability Index**: 46K token lookup table (unique asset)
4. **Open source**: Community trust and contributions

### Competitor Landscape
- **Dan Avila's templates**: Different focus (templates vs. elements)
- **Other MCP servers**: No plugin support announced
- **Direct competitors**: None identified yet

---

## Technical Notes

### Critical Implementation Details

1. **Element Naming**: Must handle variations (kebab-case, spaces, capitals)
2. **Search Functionality**: Leverage existing fuzzy matching
3. **Error Messages**: User-friendly, suggest corrections
4. **MCP Dependency**: Gracefully handle if MCP server not installed

### Integration Points

```typescript
// Plugin commands map to MCP tools
'/dollhouse enable X'  → mcp.activate_element({name: X})
'/dollhouse disable X' → mcp.deactivate_element({name: X})
'/dollhouse status'    → mcp.get_active_elements()
'/dollhouse search X'  → mcp.search_portfolio({query: X})
```

## Session Notes

### Current Session (October 9, 2025)
- Analyzed Claude Code plugin announcement
- Reviewed official documentation
- Identified gaps between speculation and reality
- Created pragmatic implementation plan
- Focus on provable value, not theoretical benefits

### Key Insights
1. The Capability Index is a client-side search engine (never loaded into Claude)
2. Hooks may not support context injection as speculated
3. Slash commands provide immediate, tangible value
4. First-mover advantage is significant

### Next Steps
1. Create plugin repository (Friday morning)
2. Implement core commands (Friday afternoon)
3. Test installation flow (Friday evening)
4. Iterate based on testing (Weekend)

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a realistic path to launching a DollhouseMCP plugin by October 15, 2025. By focusing on proven features (slash commands) and deferring speculative capabilities (hooks, context injection), we can deliver immediate value while maintaining flexibility for future enhancements.

The plugin positions DollhouseMCP as a leader in the Claude Code ecosystem, demonstrating our ability to rapidly adapt to new platform capabilities while maintaining our core MCP server functionality.

**Status**: Ready for implementation. Begin Friday, October 10, 2025.
