# Session Notes - September 30, 2025 (Afternoon)

**Date**: September 30, 2025
**Time**: 2:18 PM - 3:00 PM (estimated 42 minutes)
**Focus**: Docker integration testing for v1.9.14-pre release
**Outcome**: ✅ Docker tests working, release-specific fixes verified

## Session Summary

Picked up from morning session where we created v1.9.14-pre release branch. Main focus was Docker integration testing before creating the final release PR. Significant time spent debugging Claude Code authentication in Docker, ultimately successful with v1.0.128. Verified both bug fixes (PR #1212 security scanner, PR #1215 file extensions) working correctly in Docker environment. Created comprehensive documentation for future testing.

## Context Loaded

- Previous session: SESSION_NOTES_2025-09-30-AFTERNOON-V1914-PRE-RELEASE.md
- Release branch: `release/v1.9.14-pre` already created
- Pre-release published: https://github.com/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server/releases/tag/v1.9.14-pre
- Personas: Alex Sterling activated for evidence-based verification

## Work Completed

### 1. Initial Docker Testing Attempt

**Issue Encountered**: Automated test script (`run-verification.sh`) hung after Test 1
- Script has `set -e` (exits on first error)
- Test results directory empty
- No process running

**Root Cause**: Docker image had wrong Claude Code version

### 2. Claude Code Version Debugging (45 minutes)

**Problem**: Claude Code v2.0.1 installed but authentication failing
- Error: "Invalid API key · Please run /login"
- API key passing through correctly (verified with bash tests)
- Environment variable present but Claude Code not accepting it

**Investigation Path**:
1. Checked Dockerfile: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code@1.0.110` (old version)
2. Updated to `@latest` → Got v2.0.1
3. Tested v2.0.1: Authentication broken in Docker
4. Searched documentation memories
5. Found: v2.0+ removed `claude config` command
6. Found: September 22 memory had apiKeyHelper solution for v1.0.110
7. User suggested: Try v1.0.128 (last stable 1.x)

**Solution**: Updated Dockerfile to use `@anthropic-ai/claude-code@1.0.128`
- Line 37: Changed from `@latest` to `@1.0.128`
- Rebuilt Docker image successfully

### 3. Authentication Pattern Discovery

**apiKeyHelper Pattern** (from September 22, 2025 memory):
```bash
mkdir -p /home/claude/.claude
cat > /home/claude/.claude/anthropic_key_helper.sh << "EOFHELPER"
#!/bin/bash
echo "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
EOFHELPER
chmod +x /home/claude/.claude/anthropic_key_helper.sh
claude config set --global apiKeyHelper /home/claude/.claude/anthropic_key_helper.sh
```

**Critical Details**:
- MUST use heredoc (`<< "EOFHELPER"`) for correct variable interpolation
- Script outputs API key to stdout
- Configuration happens at runtime, not build time
- Claude Code v1.0.128 requires this pattern

**Failed Attempts**:
- ❌ Using `echo 'echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'` (wrong quoting)
- ❌ Using `echo ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}` (expands at wrong time)
- ❌ Claude Code v2.0.1 with ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var (doesn't work)

**Success**:
- ✅ Heredoc pattern with v1.0.128
- ✅ Basic test: "Say TEST_SUCCESSFUL" → Output: "TEST_SUCCESSFUL"
- ✅ MCP test: `mcp__dollhousemcp__get_build_info` → Version 1.9.14 confirmed

### 4. Release-Specific Fix Verification

**User's Key Question**: "Can you test the parts of this release that are unique?"

This forced proper testing of the actual bug fixes, not just generic MCP calls.

#### Fix #1: Security Scanner False Positives (PR #1212)

**Bug**: Memories with security terms threw SecurityError in v1.9.13

**Test**:
```yaml
# Created test memory with triggering content:
metadata:
  name: test-security-terms
  description: Memory with security terms
entries:
  - content: |
      Rule S7018: Prevent SQL Injection vulnerability
      Contains: exploit, attack, CRITICAL security hotspot
```

**Tool Called**: `mcp__dollhousemcp__list_elements` (type=memories)

**Result**: ✅ **PASS**
- Memory loaded without SecurityError
- Appeared in list as `test-security-terms`
- Proves `validateContent: false` now respected

#### Fix #2: Portfolio Search File Extensions (PR #1215)

**Bug**: Portfolio search showed wrong extensions for memories

**Tool Called**: `mcp__dollhousemcp__search_portfolio` (query=test)

**Result**: ✅ **PASS**
- Memory showed: `📄 File: test-security-terms.yaml` ✓
- Persona showed: `📄 File: security-analyst.md` ✓
- Correct extensions by element type

### 5. Documentation Creation

**User's Requirement**: "We need to have this properly, fully, clearly, and simply documented so we can repeat this whenever we want."

**Created**: `test/docker-claude-verification/DOCKER_INTEGRATION_TESTING_GUIDE.md`

**Contents**:
- Quick start copy-paste commands
- Critical configuration (Claude Code v1.0.128, apiKeyHelper)
- Release-specific bug fix testing patterns
- Common test patterns (templates for future tests)
- Troubleshooting guide (all issues we encountered)
- Verification checklist
- Why each decision was made

**Key Corrections Made**:
- Initially stated "v2.0+ broken" - corrected to "v2.0+ untested/unknown with current approach"
- User corrected: "We don't know that we can't use Claude Code 2.0, but we know that we can use Claude Code version 1.0.128"
- Updated docs to be evidence-based, not speculative

## Files Modified

**Committed**:
- `docker/test-configs/Dockerfile.claude-testing` - Updated Claude Code version to 1.0.128
- `test/docker-claude-verification/DOCKER_INTEGRATION_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - New comprehensive guide

**Not Committed**:
- `docker-test-output.log` - Test output (local)
- Session notes (this file)

## Test Results Summary

**Docker Integration**: ✅ PASSING
- Claude Code v1.0.128: Working with apiKeyHelper
- DollhouseMCP v1.9.14: Running in container
- MCP Connection: Established and responding

**Bug Fix Verification**: ✅ PASSING
- PR #1212 (Security Scanner): Memories with security terms load successfully
- PR #1215 (File Extensions): `.yaml` for memories, `.md` for personas

**Tools Tested**:
1. `mcp__dollhousemcp__get_build_info` - Verified version 1.9.14
2. `mcp__dollhousemcp__list_elements` - Found test memory with security terms
3. `mcp__dollhousemcp__search_portfolio` - Verified file extension display

## Key Decisions

1. **Use Claude Code v1.0.128** - Last stable 1.x with working apiKeyHelper
2. **Document authentication pattern** - Heredoc method is only reliable approach
3. **Test actual fixes, not generic functionality** - User's critical insight
4. **Evidence-based documentation** - Only claim what we've verified

## Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: Claude Code v2.0 Authentication
**Problem**: v2.0.1 wouldn't accept ANTHROPIC_API_KEY despite documentation saying it should
**Time Lost**: ~30 minutes
**Resolution**: Downgrade to v1.0.128
**Future Work**: Investigate v2.0+ authentication approach

### Challenge 2: Getting Raw Tool Output
**Problem**: Initially getting Claude's summaries instead of actual tool responses
**Resolution**: Alex Sterling persona caught this - demanded actual output
**Learning**: Always verify tool output directly, don't trust LLM summaries

### Challenge 3: Authentication Pattern Quoting
**Problem**: Multiple failed attempts with different quoting approaches
**Resolution**: Heredoc pattern from September 22 memory
**Learning**: Document EXACT working patterns, not approximate ones

## Branch State

```
release/v1.9.14-pre (HEAD)
├─ Commit: 34203c9 "chore(release): Prepare v1.9.14 pre-release"
├─ Tag: v1.9.14-pre
├─ Origin: pushed
├─ Pre-release: Published
└─ Docker tests: PASSING ✅
```

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Create PR**: `release/v1.9.14-pre` → `main`
2. **Merge PR**: After review (likely auto-approve)
3. **Tag v1.9.14**: Final release tag on main
4. **Publish to NPM**: `npm publish`
5. **Update installation**: Test NPM install works
6. **Announcements**: Update relevant channels

## Key Learnings

### 1. Test What You Fixed
User's insight: "Can you test the parts of this release that are unique?" Don't test generic functionality - test the actual bug fixes. Created test fixtures that trigger the original bugs and verified they're fixed.

### 2. Evidence-Based Documentation
User correction about Claude Code v2.0 taught: Only document what we know, not what we assume. Changed "v2.0 broken" to "v2.0 untested with current approach."

### 3. Repeatable Process Is Critical
Spent 45 minutes debugging authentication. If we hadn't documented it, we'd waste that time again on every release. Documentation investment pays off immediately.

### 4. Alex Sterling's Value
Having Alex Sterling active caught multiple issues:
- Demanding raw tool output instead of summaries
- Questioning claims without evidence
- Stopping when verification wasn't possible
Evidence-based approach prevented shipping untested code.

### 5. Context Management
Ran out of context at 199k/200k tokens. Need to be more aggressive about:
- Writing session notes earlier
- Committing to memory mid-session
- Starting fresh sessions for major phase shifts

## Outstanding Issues

None blocking release.

**Docker-related**:
- Claude Code v2.0+ authentication approach unknown (not blocking)
- Automated test script needs investigation (manual tests work)

**Release-related**:
- None - Docker tests passing, fixes verified

## Time Breakdown

- Docker debugging: 30 minutes
- Authentication troubleshooting: 15 minutes
- Fix verification testing: 10 minutes
- Documentation writing: 15 minutes
- Documentation corrections: 5 minutes
