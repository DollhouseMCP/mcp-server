# Session Summary - January 8, 2025 (Afternoon) - v1.2.1 Ready for Release

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Critical Bug Fixes Implemented ✅
Successfully fixed two critical data protection issues:

#### Issue #145 - Copy-on-Write for Default Personas
- **Problem**: edit_persona was modifying git-tracked default personas directly
- **Solution**: Implemented copy-on-write protection
- **Implementation**: Added DEFAULT_PERSONAS constant and logic to create copies when editing defaults
- **Impact**: Prevents git conflicts and preserves original personas

#### Issue #144 - User Personas in Backups
- **Problem**: Backups only included git-tracked files, losing user personas
- **Solution**: Added explicit persona directory backup after git archive
- **Implementation**: BackupManager now copies all .md files from personas/
- **Impact**: Prevents permanent data loss during rollback
