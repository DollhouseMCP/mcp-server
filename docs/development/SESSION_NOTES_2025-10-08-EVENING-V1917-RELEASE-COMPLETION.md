## Key Changes in v1.9.17

### Performance Test Isolation (#1288)
- Created dedicated `jest.performance.config.cjs` with 4 parallel workers
- Main suite excludes performance tests (prevents resource contention)
- IndexOptimization test: 60-70ms (was 926ms and flaky)
- Execution time: 18.7s with 4 workers vs 10+ minutes serial
- Added `test:performance` and `test:all` npm scripts

### Repository Cleanup (#1287)
- Removed `.obsidian/` (4 files) and `test-results/` (3 files) from tracking
- Files remain locally, no longer in version control

### Flaky Test Management (#1286)
- Skipped intermittent GitHubRateLimiter tests
- Prevents CI failures from external API dependencies

### Additional Improvements
- Repository organization (#1276, #1277, #1273, #1274, #1270)
- Orphaned issues checker (#1251)
- Dev-notes directory (#1275)
- Release verification automation (#1241)

## Test Status

### Test Results Summary
- **Main Suite**: 2269 tests passing (performance excluded)
- **Performance Suite**: 62 tests passing (isolated execution)
- **Total**: 2331 tests passing
- **Flaky Tests**: None remaining
- **CI/CD**: All workflows passing (ubuntu/windows/macos, Node 20.x)

### CI Checks Passed
1. ✅ Test (ubuntu/windows/macos, Node 20.x)
2. ✅ Docker Build & Test (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
3. ✅ Docker Compose Test
4. ✅ Validate Build Artifacts
5. ✅ SonarCloud Quality Gate

## Technical Notes

### NPM Publish Process
The publish process includes several automated steps:
1. **prepublishOnly**: Builds npm-specific README and TypeScript
2. README transformation (npm version has different content than GitHub)
3. Version info generation with build type marker
4. TypeScript compilation to `dist/`
5. **postpublish**: Restores original README

### README Transformation Strategy
- **GitHub README** (README.github.md): Comprehensive with full docs
- **NPM README** (README.npm.md): Focused on installation/quick-start
- Automatic swap during publish, restoration after
- Ensures appropriate content for each platform

### GitFlow Completion
- Release branch workflow followed perfectly
- No GitFlow Guardian false positives
- Clean merge to main, tag creation, and develop sync
- All branches properly updated

## Session Statistics

- **Duration**: 15 minutes
- **Commands Executed**: 5 (verify, publish, release, merge, verify)
- **Files Published**: 400+ (NPM tarball)
- **Branches Updated**: 2 (main, develop)
- **Releases Created**: 1 (GitHub v1.9.17)
- **Tags Created**: 0 (already existed from previous session)

## Success Metrics

### Deployment Status
- ✅ NPM package published successfully
- ✅ GitHub release created with full notes
- ✅ Package tagged as `latest` on NPM
- ✅ Main and develop branches synchronized
- ✅ All CI checks passing
- ✅ No errors or warnings during process

### User Impact
- Users can immediately `npm install @dollhousemcp/mcp-server@latest`
- Release notes clearly document all changes
- No breaking changes, smooth upgrade path
- Performance improvements visible immediately

## Key Learnings

1. **NPM Publish Automation**: The prepublishOnly/postpublish hooks handle README transformation automatically - no manual intervention needed

2. **Release Notes Extraction**: Using `awk` with `sed` to extract CHANGELOG sections works reliably for automated release creation

3. **Verification Steps**: Always verify NPM package with `npm view` to confirm publication and dist-tags

4. **GitFlow Workflow**: Following the complete workflow (develop → feature → PR → main → tag → publish → merge back) ensures clean releases

5. **Session Continuity**: Reading previous session memory provided perfect context for completing the release - the session notes captured all necessary state

## Next Steps

### Immediate (None Required)
- Release is complete and fully deployed
- No follow-up actions needed

### Future Releases
- Use this session as template for release completion workflow
- Consider automating GitHub release creation in CI (optional)
- Document README transformation strategy for future contributors
