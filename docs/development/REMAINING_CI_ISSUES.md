# Remaining CI Issues After PR #86

## Status as of July 6, 2025

After fixing the critical file deletion issue, these CI failures remain:

## 1. Windows Shell Syntax Issue

**Location**: `.github/workflows/core-build-test.yml` (Debug file structure step)

**Error**: 
```
Could not find a part of the path 'D:\dev\null'.
```

**Cause**: Unix-style `2>/dev/null` doesn't work in Windows PowerShell

**Current problematic code**:
```yaml
ls jest.* 2>/dev/null || echo "No jest files found"
ls src/update/ 2>/dev/null || echo "src/update not found"
# etc.
```

**Fix needed**: Use cross-platform commands or conditional logic based on runner.os

## 2. Integration Test Environment Variable

**Location**: `__tests__/integration/persona-lifecycle.test.ts`

**Error**:
```
TEST_PERSONAS_DIR environment variable is not set
```

**Fix needed**: Either:
- Set TEST_PERSONAS_DIR in CI workflow
- Update test to use default directory if not set

## Important Notes

1. These are **NOT** related to the file deletion issue
2. The file deletion fix is working correctly
3. These appear to be pre-existing issues
4. Core functionality and local development work fine

## Next Steps

See Issue #88 for detailed recommendations and fixes.
