## üéØ Essential Dollhouse Elements (Load These First!)

### 1. Personas (Critical)

**sonar-guardian** - Your primary guide
```
mcp__dollhousemcp-production__activate_element --name sonar-guardian --type personas
```

**What it provides**:
- Complete SonarCloud workflow knowledge
- GitFlow awareness (ALWAYS work on feature branches!)
- Code modernization standards
- Quality gate requirements
- **Auto-loads**: sonarcloud-modernizer, sonarcloud-fix-template, sonar-sweep-agent

**Key reminder from sonar-guardian**:
- NEVER work on main/develop directly
- ALWAYS create feature branch: `feature/sonarcloud-{rule-id}-fixes`
- ALWAYS use correct query procedure (query by changed files!)

---

**alex-sterling** - Your quality guardian
```
mcp__dollhousemcp-production__activate_element --name alex-sterling --type personas
```

**What it provides**:
- Evidence-based approach (no fake work!)
- STOP at uncertainty protocol
- Complete issue reporting (report all, decide none)
- Verification discipline

**Key reminder from alex-sterling**:
- READ before WRITE
- TEST before CLAIM
- STOP at UNCERTAINTY
- REPORT ALL issues found (don't filter!)

---

### 2. Memories (Essential Knowledge)

**sonarcloud-rules-reference** - Rule lookup
```
mcp__dollhousemcp-production__activate_element --name sonarcloud-rules-reference --type memories
```
Instant lookup for rule IDs, descriptions, and remediation patterns

---

**sonarcloud-api-reference** - API patterns
```
mcp__dollhousemcp-production__activate_element --name sonarcloud-api-reference --type memories
```
Complete API reference for programmatic issue management

---

**sonarcloud-query-procedure** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL!**
```
mcp__dollhousemcp-production__activate_element --name sonarcloud-query-procedure --type memories
```

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE!**

**Why critical**: Generic queries return ALL issues across entire codebase, including OLD issues you didn't create. This causes you to waste time fixing issues that aren't yours.

**The correct way**:
```bash
# Step 1: Get YOUR changed files
git diff develop...HEAD --name-only

# Step 2: Query EACH file individually
mcp__sonarqube__issues \
  --pull_request <PR_NUM> \
  --components "<specific_file_path>" \
  --output_mode content \
  -n true

# Step 3: Fix issues in THAT file only
# Step 4: Re-query to verify fixes
```

**RED FLAGS - DO NOT DO THIS**:
- ‚ùå `mcp__sonarqube__issues --pull_request 1215` (no --components) ‚Üí Returns thousands of irrelevant issues
- ‚ùå Fixing issues with old creationDate ‚Üí Those aren't your issues
- ‚ùå Fixing issues in files you didn't modify ‚Üí Pre-existing technical debt

---

**sonarcloud-reliability-session-prep** - Process guide
```
mcp__dollhousemcp-production__activate_element --name sonarcloud-reliability-session-prep --type memories
```
Lessons from successful hotspot clearance - best practices and methodology

---

### 3. Skills (Automation Tools)

**sonarcloud-modernizer** - Automated fixes
```
mcp__dollhousemcp-production__activate_element --name sonarcloud-modernizer --type skills
```

**What it provides**:
- Automated find/sed scripts for bulk fixes
- Number.parseInt modernization patterns
- String.replaceAll conversion patterns
- Array constructor fixes
- Node.js import modernization

**Key patterns**:
```bash
# S7773: parseInt ‚Üí Number.parseInt
find . -name "*.ts" -exec sed -i '' 's/\bparseInt(/Number.parseInt(/g' {} \;

# S7781: replace(/g/) ‚Üí replaceAll() (requires manual review!)
# More complex - see skill for details

# S7723: Array() ‚Üí new Array()
find . -name "*.ts" -exec sed -i 's/\bArray(\([0-9]\+\))/new Array(\1)/g' {} \;
```

## üìö Essential Documentation (Read These!)

### 1. Triage Document (Your Roadmap)
**Location**: `docs/development/SONARCLOUD_RELIABILITY_TRIAGE.md`

**What it contains**:
- Complete breakdown of all 262 issues
- Detailed implementation plans for each category
- Automation scripts ready to use
- Risk assessment and testing strategies
- Step-by-step guides for each GitHub issue

**Read this FIRST** before starting any issue!

---

### 2. GitFlow Documentation
**Location**: `docs/development/GITFLOW_GUARDIAN.md`

**Critical rules**:
- NEVER commit to main or develop directly
- ALWAYS create feature branch from develop
- Branch naming: `feature/sonarcloud-{rule-id}-{description}`
- ALWAYS push with `-u` flag first time: `git push -u origin feature/...`
- ALWAYS create PR to develop (NOT main!)

---

### 3. Query Procedure Documentation
**Location**: `docs/development/SONARCLOUD_QUERY_PROCEDURE.md`

**Why critical**: Prevents wasting time on wrong issues. Read this carefully!

---

## üîß Environment Setup Checklist

Before starting ANY issue, verify:

### 1. Check Current Branch
```bash
git branch --show-current
# Should show: develop, feature/*, or fix/*
# Should NOT show: main
```

### 2. Verify SonarCloud Token
```bash
echo ${SONARQUBE_TOKEN:0:10}...
# Should show: first 10 chars of token
# If empty: Token not set!
```

### 3. Check SonarCloud MCP Connection
```bash
# Try a simple query
mcp__sonarqube__system_ping
# Should return: pong or OK status
```

### 4. Verify Working Directory
```bash
pwd
# Should show: /Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server
```

### 5. Check Git Status
```bash
git status
# Should show: clean working directory on develop or feature branch
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Reminders

### GitFlow (NEVER FORGET!)
1. Check you're on develop: `git checkout develop && git pull`
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/sonarcloud-s7773-parseint`
3. Verify branch: `git branch --show-current`
4. Make changes
5. Push with -u first time: `git push -u origin feature/sonarcloud-s7773-parseint`
6. Create PR to develop: `gh pr create --base develop`

### Query Procedure (NEVER SKIP!)
1. Always use `--components` with specific file path
2. Check `creationDate` matches your work
3. Only fix issues in files YOU changed
4. Re-query after fixes to verify

### Testing (NEVER SKIP!)
After EVERY change:
```bash
npm run build     # Must succeed
npm test          # Must pass
npm run lint      # Should pass (may have intentional violations)
```

## üÜò Common Issues & Solutions

### Problem: "Token not found" error
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check token is set
echo $SONARQUBE_TOKEN
# If empty, token needs to be configured
```

### Problem: "Cannot create branch - already exists"
**Solution**:
```bash
# Delete old branch if work was abandoned
git branch -D feature/old-branch
# Or switch to existing branch
git checkout feature/existing-branch
```

### Problem: Query returns thousands of issues
**Solution**: You forgot to use `--components`! Read SONARCLOUD_QUERY_PROCEDURE.md again.

### Problem: Tests failing after changes
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check what files changed
git diff --stat

# Review changes in specific file
git diff path/to/file.ts

# If changes look correct, investigate test failures
npm test -- path/to/failing.test.ts
```

### Problem: SonarCloud shows issues after PR
**Solution**: Wait for CI to complete (can take 5-10 min). Then re-query to verify.

---

## üìä Success Metrics

Track your progress:
- Issues resolved per session
- Time per issue category
- Test success rate
- PR merge success rate

**Goal**: Maintain ~7-10 issues resolved per minute for automated fixes (proven rate from hotspot session)

---

## üéì Key Learnings from Previous Sessions

### From Hotspot Clearance (243 hotspots ‚Üí 0)
1. **Batch operations win**: Group similar issues, evaluate together
2. **Context matters**: Static analysis flags patterns, not actual bugs
3. **Rate limiting works**: 0.3s between API calls = 0% failures
4. **Documentation prevents rework**: Clear comments save future time
5. **Automation scales**: Scripts handle hundreds of issues in minutes

### From Initial Reliability Triage
1. **Pagination is real**: Check ALL pages (262 issues, not 11!)
2. **Query by impact**: Use `impactSoftwareQualities=RELIABILITY`, not `types=BUG`
3. **95% is automatable**: Most issues have scripted solutions
4. **Test false positives are common**: Intentional patterns often flagged

---

## üìû Getting Help

If stuck:
1. **Check triage doc**: `docs/development/SONARCLOUD_RELIABILITY_TRIAGE.md`
2. **Check query procedure**: `docs/development/SONARCLOUD_QUERY_PROCEDURE.md`
3. **Review GitHub issue**: Each issue has detailed implementation plan
4. **Ask user**: If genuinely blocked, ask for guidance

---
