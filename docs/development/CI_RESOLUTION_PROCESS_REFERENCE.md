# CI Resolution Process Reference - July 6, 2025

## Critical Context for Future Sessions

This document captures the complete state of our CI resolution efforts, including the process, decisions, and current testing approach. This is essential for continuing work if we run out of context.

## The Core Problem

### What's Happening
- Jest tests pass locally (211 tests) but fail in CI environments
- Error: `Cannot find module '../../../src/update/BackupManager.js'`
- This started after refactoring from monolithic `index.ts` to modular structure

### Root Cause Hypothesis
The refactoring from a single file to multiple files across directories created a module resolution issue that only manifests in CI. The combination of:
- TypeScript requiring `.js` extensions for ESM imports
- Jest trying to resolve these `.js` files (which don't exist - we only have `.ts`)
- Different working directories or module resolution in CI vs local

## Current PR Status: #80

### Branch: `fix-ci-critical-issues`

### What We've Done So Far

#### 1. Path Resolution Fixes (âœ… Completed)
- Replaced all `__dirname` with `process.cwd()` in:
  - `src/update/VersionManager.ts`
  - `src/update/UpdateManager.ts` 
  - `src/update/BackupManager.ts`
  - `src/index.ts`
- Implemented upward search for package.json (max 5 levels)

#### 2. Import Consistency (âœ… Completed)
- Added `.js` extensions to all test imports
- This is required for ESM compatibility

#### 3. Jest Configuration Attempts (ðŸ”„ Multiple Iterations)
- Added `moduleNameMapper` patterns
- Updated all paths to use `<rootDir>` prefix
- Added `ts-jest-resolver` package
- Set `resolver: 'ts-jest-resolver'` in config
- Added `NODE_OPTIONS: '--experimental-vm-modules'` to CI

#### 4. Documentation (âœ… Comprehensive)
- Created multiple reference documents
- Documented all approaches and reasoning
- Created diagnostic guides

### Current Testing Approach: Compile-First (Option A)

We implemented a diagnostic approach to test our hypothesis:

```javascript
// jest.config.compiled.cjs - Tests compiled JavaScript instead of TypeScript
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  rootDir: '.',
  testMatch: [
    '<rootDir>/dist/**/__tests__/**/*.test.js',
    '<rootDir>/dist/**/?(*.)+(spec|test).js'
  ],
  transform: {}, // No transformation - using compiled JS
  moduleNameMapper: {} // No mapping - real files exist
};
```

**New Scripts Added:**
- `npm run build:test` - Compiles with tsconfig.test.json
- `npm run test:compiled` - Runs tests on compiled output
- `npm run test:compiled:ci` - CI version

**CI Workflow Change:**
```yaml
- name: Run test suite (original method)
  id: original_tests
  run: npm test
  continue-on-error: true

- name: Run test suite (compiled method) - DIAGNOSTIC
  if: steps.original_tests.outcome == 'failure'
  run: |
    echo "=== Original tests failed, trying compiled approach ==="
    npm run test:compiled:ci
```

## The Workflow Update Problem

### Critical Issue We Discovered
- PR CI runs use the workflow from `main` branch, NOT the PR branch
- Our diagnostic workflow changes won't run until AFTER merge
- We can't test our fix in the same PR that introduces it

### This Means
1. Current CI will still fail (using old workflow)
2. We won't see diagnostic results until after merge
3. We're merging based on local testing + reviewer confidence

## What to Watch For After Merge

### Success Indicators
1. **Original tests still fail** - Expected, confirms the issue persists
2. **Compiled tests pass** - This confirms our hypothesis about the refactoring
3. **Diagnostic output shows** - We'll see "Original tests failed, trying compiled approach"

### Failure Indicators
1. **Both approaches fail** - Problem is deeper than module resolution
2. **Compiled tests fail differently** - Might indicate circular dependencies
3. **No diagnostic output** - Workflow changes didn't apply correctly

## Next Steps Based on Outcomes

### If Compiled Tests Pass in CI
1. **Confirmed**: The modular refactoring broke Jest+TypeScript+ESM resolution
2. **Decision Needed**:
   - Keep compile-first approach permanently
   - Investigate alternative Jest configurations
   - Consider different test runners (Vitest, etc.)

### If Compiled Tests Also Fail
1. **Investigate**: 
   - Circular dependencies introduced during refactor
   - Environment-specific issues beyond module resolution
   - Working directory problems
2. **Try**:
   - Running tests from different directories
   - Checking for missing environment variables
   - Analyzing import/export patterns

## Key Files and Their Current State

### Modified Core Files
- `src/update/VersionManager.ts` - Uses upward search for package.json
- `src/update/UpdateManager.ts` - Uses process.cwd()
- `src/update/BackupManager.ts` - Uses process.cwd()
- `src/index.ts` - Uses process.cwd()

### Configuration Files
- `jest.config.cjs` - Has ts-jest-resolver and moduleNameMapper
- `jest.config.compiled.cjs` - New file for testing compiled output
- `tsconfig.test.json` - Existing file used for test compilation
- `.github/workflows/core-build-test.yml` - Has diagnostic steps

### Documentation Created
- `/docs/development/CI_FIXES_SESSION_2025_07_06.md`
- `/docs/development/JEST_CI_MODULE_RESOLUTION_ISSUE.md`
- `/docs/development/PR_80_COMPREHENSIVE_CONTEXT.md`
- `/docs/development/CI_JEST_DIAGNOSIS_AND_REFACTOR_ANALYSIS.md`
- This file: `/docs/development/CI_RESOLUTION_PROCESS_REFERENCE.md`

## Critical Information Not to Lose

### The .dockerignore Issue
- File keeps getting deleted in commits
- Always check and restore it before pushing
- It's required for Docker builds

### PR Review Bot Requirements
- ALL documentation must be in the commit/code
- Don't add separate PR comments after commits
- The bot needs full context in the code changes

### Local Test Results
- Original approach: 211 tests pass
- Compiled approach: 215 tests pass (4 integration tests need TEST_PERSONAS_DIR)
- Docker tests: Always passed (they use compiled JS)

## Commands for Next Session

### To Check CI Results
```bash
gh pr checks 80
gh run view <run-id> --log | grep -A10 "Original tests failed"
```

### To Test Locally
```bash
# Original approach
npm test

# Compiled approach
npm run test:compiled

# Specific test
npm run test:compiled -- --testNamePattern="BackupManager"
```

### To Continue Investigation
```bash
# Check for circular dependencies
npx madge --circular src/

# Check module resolution
NODE_OPTIONS="--experimental-vm-modules" node --eval "import('./src/update/BackupManager.js')"
```

## Summary for Next Session

**Current State**: We've implemented a diagnostic compile-first approach to test if the CI failures are due to the monolithic-to-modular refactoring. The PR is approved but we can't see the diagnostic results until after merge because CI uses workflows from main branch.

**Next Action**: After merge, immediately check CI results to see if compiled tests pass when original tests fail. This will confirm or refute our hypothesis.

**Decision Point**: Based on CI results, either adopt compile-first testing permanently or investigate deeper issues with the module structure.

**Remember**: The core issue is Jest can't resolve TypeScript files with .js imports in CI, but works locally. This suggests environmental differences in module resolution.
