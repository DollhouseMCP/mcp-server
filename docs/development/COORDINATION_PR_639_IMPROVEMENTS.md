## Progress Tracking

### Agent 1 Progress (Code Quality)
- Status: COMPLETED
- Current task: All Priority 1 tasks completed
- Completed:
  - ✅ Created portfolio-constants.ts config file for all timeout values and magic numbers
  - ✅ Extracted hardcoded timeout value 30000ms to getValidatedTimeout() function
  - ✅ Extracted magic number 10 * 1024 * 1024 to FILE_SIZE_LIMITS.MAX_FILE_SIZE
  - ✅ Extracted retry delay calculation to calculateRetryDelay() function
  - ✅ Replaced 'metadata: any' with PortfolioElementMetadata interface
  - ✅ Made timeout configurable via DOLLHOUSE_GITHUB_API_TIMEOUT environment variable
  - ✅ Updated all similarity scores and max suggestions to use SEARCH_CONFIG constants
  - ✅ All existing tests passing (148/148 portfolio-related tests pass)
- Notes: 
  - All changes maintain backward compatibility
  - Environment variables have sensible defaults
  - Added validation helpers for timeout bounds
  - Updated config index.ts to export new constants

### Agent 2 Progress (Refactoring)
- Status: COMPLETED
- Current task: All refactoring tasks completed
- Completed:
  - ✅ Analyzed execute method structure and identified 8 logical sections for extraction
  - ✅ Extracted parameter validation and normalization logic into validateAndNormalizeParams()
  - ✅ Extracted authentication checking logic into checkAuthentication()
  - ✅ Extracted content discovery and type detection logic into discoverContentWithTypeDetection()
  - ✅ Extracted file validation and security checks into validateFileAndContent()
  - ✅ Extracted metadata preparation logic into prepareElementMetadata()
  - ✅ Extracted GitHub repository preparation logic into setupGitHubRepository()
  - ✅ Extracted element submission and response formatting into submitElementAndHandleResponse()
  - ✅ Added comprehensive JSDoc comments for all new private methods
  - ✅ Maintained identical functionality - all tests passing (17/17 portfolio tests pass)
  - ✅ Achieved 78% line reduction in main execute method (278 → 62 lines)
- Notes:
  - Execute method reduced from 278 lines to 62 lines (216 line reduction)
  - Created 6 focused private methods with single responsibilities
  - All methods have proper error handling and return type safety
  - Maintained backward compatibility and existing API contracts
  - Each extracted method has clear JSDoc documentation

### Agent 3 Progress (Security)
- Status: COMPLETED
- Current task: All security enhancement tasks completed
- Completed:
  - ✅ **Task #5 - Token Expiration Checks**: Implemented validateTokenBeforeUsage() method with comprehensive validation
    - Added format validation before API calls
    - Implemented GitHub API validation to check token expiration and permissions
    - Added token freshness detection using rate limit headers
    - Integrated validation into both portfolio creation and collection submission flows
    - Added comprehensive security event logging for audit trails
    - Graceful handling of rate-limited validation attempts
  - ✅ **Task #7 - Path Validation**: Created validatePortfolioPath() method with enhanced security
    - Comprehensive path traversal prevention (../,  \\..\\, etc.)
    - Control character and null byte detection
    - Suspicious pattern detection (hex encoding, template literals, etc.)
    - Platform-specific path length validation (Windows: 260 chars, Unix: 4096 chars)
    - File extension whitelist validation (.md, .json, .yml, .yaml, .txt only)
    - Filename character validation (alphanumeric + safe special characters only)
    - Path normalization with security checks
    - Integrated into validateFileAndContent() method
  - ✅ **Task #14 - Token Refresh Logic**: Implemented smart token management for long operations  
    - Created manageTokenForLongOperation() method for different operation types
    - Added token aging detection and refresh recommendations
    - Implemented formatTokenRefreshGuidance() for user guidance
    - Enhanced error handling with token-specific troubleshooting steps
    - Added operation-specific token management (portfolio_creation, collection_submission, file_upload)
    - Graceful degradation when tokens are near expiration
    - User-friendly guidance for OAuth vs Personal Access Token refresh procedures
- Notes:
  - All 148 portfolio-related tests passing (100% backward compatibility maintained)
  - Security enhancements provide defense-in-depth without impacting user experience
  - Token validation includes intelligent caching to avoid rate limit abuse
  - Path validation covers Windows and Unix attack vectors comprehensively
  - Token management provides proactive guidance rather than reactive failures
  - All security events logged to SecurityMonitor for audit compliance
