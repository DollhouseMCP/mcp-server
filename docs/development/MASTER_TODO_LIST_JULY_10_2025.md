## Implementation Notes

### Priority Levels
1. **Immediate**: Must be done in next session
2. **High**: Critical for user satisfaction or security
3. **Medium**: Important for growth and adoption
4. **Low**: Nice-to-have or future considerations

### Dependencies
- NPM publishing blocks announcement and adoption
- Security enhancements block enterprise adoption
- Export/Import features block collaboration features
- API development blocks third-party integrations
- Performance optimization blocks scaling

### Success Metrics
- **Short-term**: v1.2.2 published, security complete
- **Medium-term**: Active users, marketplace growth
- **Long-term**: Multi-platform support, monetization

### Resource Requirements
- **Development**: Primary focus on features
