# Outstanding Issues - July 5, 2025

## Summary
This document tracks issues that remain unresolved after the integration test implementation and GitHubClient TypeScript fix.

## Issue #55 - GitHubClient.test.ts TypeScript/Jest Issues

### Current Status
- **PR #56 Created**: Partial fix for TypeScript compilation errors
- **TypeScript errors**: Resolved with type assertions
- **Runtime errors**: Still failing due to ESM/CommonJS module issues

### Problem Details
1. **TypeScript Issue (RESOLVED)**: 
   - Jest mock functions were being inferred as type 'never'
   - Fixed by adding `as any` type assertions

2. **ESM Module Issue (UNRESOLVED)**:
   ```
   SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
   at @modelcontextprotocol/sdk/dist/types.js:1
   ```

### Potential Solutions
1. Update Jest configuration to properly handle ESM modules from @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
2. Use a different import strategy for the SDK
3. Mock the entire @modelcontextprotocol/sdk module
4. Update to a newer version of the SDK if available

## Other Outstanding Items from Previous Session

### High Priority Issues
1. **Issue #28**: ARM64 Docker test failing (67% Docker test coverage)
2. **Issue #29**: Add MCP protocol integration tests
3. **Issue #30**: Research multi-platform MCP compatibility

### Medium Priority Tasks
From Integration Test Todo List:
- Add GitHub API integration tests for TestServer
- Add APICache and rate limiting integration tests  
- Add user identity system integration tests
- Add MCP protocol compliance tests
- Add CI/CD integration for integration tests

### Low Priority Optimizations
- Optimize file operations with batching
- Consider splitting large test files
- Reduce integration test timeout from 30s to 15-20s

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix ESM Module Issue**: Research and implement proper ESM handling for @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
2. **Complete PR #56**: Get GitHubClient tests fully working
3. **CI/CD Green**: Achieve 100% test pass rate

### Short Term
1. Implement missing integration tests (GitHub API, Cache, etc.)
2. Fix ARM64 Docker issue for 100% Docker coverage
3. Add MCP protocol compliance tests

### Long Term
1. Universal MCP platform support research
2. Performance optimizations
3. Enhanced test coverage metrics

## Environment Details
- **Node**: 20.x
- **TypeScript**: 5.8.3
- **Jest**: 30.0.3
- **@modelcontextprotocol/sdk**: Latest

## Notes
The project has made significant progress with:
- ✅ Integration test framework (11 tests, 100% passing)
- ✅ Fixed all critical PR review issues
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ⚠️ GitHubClient tests partially fixed (TypeScript only)
- ❌ ESM module compatibility remains an issue
