# Docker CI Final Coordination - Mission Complete ✅

**Date**: August 17, 2025  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**PRs**: #611 (Merged), #606 (Conflicts in progress)

## Executive Summary

Successfully fixed all Docker CI issues using multi-agent orchestration approach. The MCP server is now fully functional in Docker containers and responding to API calls.

## Final Solution

### Root Cause
Docker tmpfs mounts create directories owned by root:root (0:0), not respecting the --user 1001:1001 flag.

### Fix Applied
Added `mode=1777` to all tmpfs mount points:
- `/tmp:noexec,nosuid,mode=1777`
- `/app/tmp:noexec,nosuid,mode=1777`
- `/app/logs:noexec,nosuid,mode=1777`

### Files Modified in PR #611
1. `docker/docker-compose.yml` - Added mode=1777 to tmpfs
2. `.github/workflows/docker-testing.yml` - Added mode=1777 to tmpfs
3. `docker/Dockerfile` - Added env vars for portfolio/cache dirs
4. `src/cache/CollectionCache.ts` - Respects DOLLHOUSE_CACHE_DIR env var

## MCP Server Verification

### Confirmed Working
The server successfully responds to MCP protocol:
```json
{
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-06-18",
    "capabilities": {"tools": {}},
    "serverInfo": {
      "name": "dollhousemcp",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  },
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1
}
```

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Docker Build & Test (linux/amd64) - PASSING
- ✅ Docker Build & Test (linux/arm64) - PASSING  
- ✅ Docker Compose Test - PASSING
- ✅ MCP initialize command - WORKING
- ✅ Portfolio directory creation - WORKING
- ✅ Cache directory creation - WORKING

## PR #606 Status

### Remaining Work
Need to resolve `.github/workflows/docker-testing.yml` conflict by combining:
- PR #606's prebuilt Docker approach (fixes timeouts)
- PR #611's tmpfs permissions (fixes directory access)

### Resolution Strategy
1. Keep prebuilt TypeScript compilation from #606
2. Add mode=1777 to tmpfs mounts from #611
3. Use both test approaches (tools/list and initialize)

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Docker tmpfs permissions**: Always specify mode for tmpfs mounts with non-root users
2. **Multi-agent debugging**: Parallel investigation is highly effective
3. **CI environment differences**: Test locally with exact CI constraints
4. **MCP protocol verification**: Check for actual JSON-RPC responses, not just logs

## Next Session Priority

Complete PR #606 by:
1. Resolving docker-testing.yml conflict
2. Pushing resolved changes
3. Monitoring CI for success
4. Merging PR #606 once tests pass
