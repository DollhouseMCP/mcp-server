# Full Session Context - July 23, 2025 Evening

## Session Timeline
- Started around 2:15 PM
- User mentioned "done a ton of work today"
- This was an evening session following earlier work

## Critical Context Not in Other Docs

### 1. Terminology Decision Process
We went through extensive brainstorming for what to call the elements:
- Started with "enhancement" vs "accessory" as favorites
- Explored dollhouse-themed options (furnishing, appointments, fixtures)
- User's thought process: "They customize what any particular AI is going to do... refine, focus, highlight particular concepts"
- **Final decision**: "AI Customization Elements" - clear, descriptive, captures the purpose

### 2. Release Version Decision
- User explicitly said "1.3 rather than 1.25" (not 1.2.5)
- Reason: "significant change in the back end and there are some breaking changes"
- This was a deliberate version bump decision

### 3. Critical Requirements from User
- **Separate branches and PRs**: "Make sure to do separate branches for all these steps where appropriate with proper pull requests. I want to get the code review from this."
- **Test all element types**: "you need to test not just personas but all the element types"
- **Both directions**: Test collection connectivity AND ensure default elements exist in collection

### 4. Dollhouse Personas Repository
- User wants to "archive or hide or remove" the old personas repository
- It "talks about the marketplace and we no longer use that language"
- "adding confusion and it doesn't connect with anything any longer"

### 5. Website Deployment
- User has "a good template with good content"
- User has "some logos that we can use"
- This is POST-release priority

### 6. Missing Release Plan
- User asked to check "release_plan_July_23_2025.md"
- This file doesn't exist - we never found it

### 7. Outstanding Issues Analysis
- **#361** (EnsembleManager tests): Determined NOT a release blocker
- **#362** (Element factory): Enhancement, NOT a release blocker
- User wanted to ensure these "aren't going to be breaking changes causing errors or crashes"

### 8. Collection Integration Discovery Process
- Initially tested just personas connectivity
- User corrected: need to test ALL element types
- Discovered memories directory returns 404
- Found only 5 of 31 elements exist in collection

### 9. Work Completed Earlier Today
Based on priority docs, earlier sessions completed:
- PR #359 (Ensemble element) - merged successfully
- PR #375 - Default elements with security analysis suite
- Issue #372 - Created 26 default elements
- Removed 'parallel' activation strategy

### 10. IDE Context
User opened these files during session:
- `/Users/mick/Developer/MCP-Servers/DollhouseMCP/src/index.ts`
- `/Users/mick/Developer/MCP-Servers/DollhouseMCP/README.md`
- `/Users/mick/Developer/MCP-Servers/DollhouseMCP/src/collection/index.ts`

### 11. Specific Missing Elements
Detailed list of what needs uploading to collection:
- **Personas**: business-consultant, debug-detective, eli5-explainer, security-analyst, technical-analyst
- **Skills**: code-review, creative-writing, data-analysis, penetration-testing, research, threat-modeling, translation
- **Templates**: code-documentation, email-professional, meeting-notes, penetration-test-report, report-executive, security-vulnerability-report, threat-assessment-report
- **Agents**: code-reviewer, task-manager
- **Memories**: ALL THREE (conversation-history, learning-progress, project-context)
- **Ensembles**: business-advisor, creative-studio, development-team, security-analysis-team

### 12. Security Analysis Suite
Part of the 31 elements includes enterprise-grade security tools:
- security-analyst persona
- penetration-testing and threat-modeling skills
- Three security report templates
- security-analysis-team ensemble

### 13. Breaking Changes Details
- PersonaInstaller class completely removed
- Collection paths must now include element type
- Old: `personas/creative/writer.md`
- New: `library/personas/creative/writer.md`

### 14. User's Working Style
- Wants code review on everything
- Prefers separate branches and PRs
- Values documentation for handoffs
- Concerned about missing things without review

### 15. Element System Architecture Understanding
From earlier docs:
- Ensembles = ONE unified entity (not multiple characters)
- Issue #363 created for future "Cast of Characters" feature
- Element system allows layering capabilities

## Commands and Status

### Current Branch
`feature/element-installer-v1.3.0` - pushed to origin

### Uncommitted Changes
None - all work committed and pushed

### Key File Changes
1. Created: `src/collection/ElementInstaller.ts`
2. Deleted: `src/collection/PersonaInstaller.ts`
3. Modified: `src/index.ts` - uses ElementInstaller
4. Modified: `src/collection/index.ts` - exports ElementInstaller
5. Modified: `package.json` - version 1.3.0

### GitHub Issues Created
- #376: Upload all 31 default AI customization elements to collection
- #377: Fix missing memories directory in collection (404 error)

## What Makes This Session Special
This was the session where we:
1. Discovered the collection is fundamentally broken for v1.3.0
2. Made the architectural change to support all element types
3. Established "AI Customization Elements" as our terminology
4. Identified that we can't release without fixing the collection

## Recovery Instructions
If picking up fresh:
1. Read SESSION_HANDOFF_JULY_23_EVENING.md first
2. Check RELEASE_BLOCKERS_v1.3.0.md for what's blocking release
3. The ElementInstaller work is DONE, just needs PR
4. Main work is in the collection repository now
