# Session Notes - September 26, 2025 (Afternoon/Evening)

## Session Overview
**Time**: ~4:00 PM - 5:15 PM PT
**Focus**: Memory trigger extraction for Enhanced Index (Issue #1124)
**Branch**: `feature/memory-trigger-extraction`
**PR**: #1133

## Initial Context
- Started with PR #1130 (hotfix for ESM-incompatible tests) - successfully merged
- Created follow-up issues #1131 and #1132 for ESM test improvements
- Main task: Implement trigger extraction for Memory elements per Issue #1124

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Memory Trigger Implementation ✅
Successfully implemented trigger extraction for Memory elements:
- Added `triggers` field to MemoryMetadata interface
- Updated MemoryManager to extract triggers from YAML metadata
- Modified Memory constructor to preserve and sanitize triggers
- Fixed BaseElement to preserve metadata fields like triggers

### 2. Review-Driven Improvements ✅
Based on excellent PR review feedback:
- Added `MAX_TRIGGER_LENGTH` constant for maintainability
- Implemented `TRIGGER_VALIDATION_REGEX` for alphanumeric + hyphens/underscores
- Added comprehensive edge case tests (invalid characters, long lists, truncation)
- Created performance test suite (handles 200+ triggers efficiently)

### 3. Critical Bug Fixes ✅
Discovered and fixed test failures:
- **BaseElement metadata spreading issue**: Initial approach broke YAML serialization
  - Fixed by selectively preserving only safe fields like 'triggers'
- **Memory integration test path issues**: Tests were using full paths instead of relative
- **Reduced test failures from 7 → 3 test suites**

## Test Status Analysis

### Remaining Test Failures (3 suites)
1. **IndexConfig.test.ts**
   - Root cause: Local config file `~/.dollhouse/portfolio/.config/index-config.json` overriding defaults
   - NOT our fault - will pass in clean CI environment

2. **memory-enhanced-index.test.ts**
   - Symptom: Test hanging/timing out
   - Potentially related to our changes (needs investigation)
   - Note: All unit tests pass successfully

3. **docker-security.test.ts**
   - Docker build failure during `npm run build`
   - Environment-specific issue

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified
- `src/elements/memories/Memory.ts` - Added triggers support with validation
- `src/elements/memories/MemoryManager.ts` - Extract triggers from YAML
- `src/elements/BaseElement.ts` - Selective metadata preservation
- `test/unit/MemoryManager.triggers.test.ts` - Comprehensive unit tests
- `test/unit/MemoryManager.triggers.performance.test.ts` - Performance tests
- `test/integration/memory-enhanced-index.test.ts` - Integration with Enhanced Index
- `test/fixtures/memory-with-triggers.yaml` - Test fixture

### Key Implementation Details
```typescript
// Memory.ts - Trigger validation
const MAX_TRIGGER_LENGTH = 50;
const TRIGGER_VALIDATION_REGEX = /^[a-zA-Z0-9\-_]+$/;

// BaseElement.ts - Selective metadata preservation
if ('triggers' in metadata && Array.isArray((metadata as any).triggers)) {
  baseMetadata.triggers = (metadata as any).triggers;
}
```

## Issues Created
- #1131: Rewrite ESM-incompatible tests with proper mocking patterns
- #1132: Audit codebase for jest.unstable_mockModule usage

## PR Status
- PR #1133: Open, awaiting final CI results
- Security audit: ✅ Passing
- Code review: ✅ Approved by Claude
- Test status: 3 failures (mostly environment-specific)

## 🎯 CRITICAL NEXT STEPS FOR NEXT SESSION

### Priority 1: Fix Memory Integration Test Hanging
```bash
# 1. First, isolate the exact cause of hanging
cd active/mcp-server
npm test -- test/integration/memory-enhanced-index.test.ts --verbose --detectOpenHandles

# 2. If it hangs, try running individual test cases
npm test -- test/integration/memory-enhanced-index.test.ts -t "should find memories with remember trigger"

# 3. Check if it's the EnhancedIndexManager rebuild that's hanging
# Look specifically at line 82: await enhancedIndex.rebuild();
```

### Priority 2: Verify CI Environment
```bash
# Check latest CI results
gh pr checks 1133 --watch

# If tests still fail in CI, get the actual CI logs
gh run view [run-id] --log-failed | grep -A 20 "memory-enhanced-index"
```

### Priority 3: Debug Strategies
If memory integration test is still hanging:
1. **Add timeout to rebuild**:
   ```typescript
   await Promise.race([
     enhancedIndex.rebuild(),
     new Promise((_, reject) => setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Timeout')), 5000))
   ]);
   ```

2. **Check for circular dependencies**: The Enhanced Index might be trying to load memories that trigger another index rebuild

3. **Add debug logging**:
   ```typescript
   console.log('Starting rebuild...');
   await enhancedIndex.rebuild();
   console.log('Rebuild complete');
   ```

### Priority 4: Final Cleanup
Once tests pass:
1. Squash commits if needed
2. Update PR description with final status
3. Request merge to develop

### Environment Notes
- **Local config issue**: `~/.dollhouse/portfolio/.config/index-config.json` causes IndexConfig test to fail locally
- To test without it: `mv ~/.dollhouse/portfolio/.config/index-config.json ~/.dollhouse/portfolio/.config/index-config.json.backup`
- Docker tests may require Docker Desktop running

### Test Commands Reference
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- test/integration/memory-enhanced-index.test.ts

# Run with timeout (macOS)
gtimeout 30 npm test -- test/integration/memory-enhanced-index.test.ts

# Check test summary only
npm test 2>&1 | grep "Test Suites:" | tail -1

# Run memory trigger tests
npm test -- test/unit/MemoryManager.triggers.test.ts
```

## Key Learnings
1. **Always verify test failures are actually our fault** - Don't dismiss as "unrelated"
2. **Metadata spreading in BaseElement is dangerous** - Can break YAML serialization
3. **Local config files can cause test failures** - CI environment is cleaner
4. **Performance tests need to respect size limits** - SecureYamlParser has 10KB limit

## Status for Handoff
- ✅ Memory trigger extraction fully implemented
- ✅ Code review approved
- ✅ Security audit passing
- ⚠️ 3 test failures remain (1 definitely not ours, 2 need investigation)
- 📝 Clear next steps documented above

The memory trigger feature is essentially complete and working. The remaining work is primarily debugging why the integration test hangs and confirming CI passes.
