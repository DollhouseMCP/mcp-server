# PR #260 Critical Notes - MUST READ

## THE CORE ISSUE
**CI shows 172 findings, local shows 32. The difference is test files not being suppressed.**

## THE SMOKING GUN
In the CI logs, you'll see findings like:
```
OWASP-A01-001: Hardcoded Secrets
File: /home/runner/work/mcp-server/mcp-server/__tests__/unit/TokenManager.test.ts
```

This SHOULD be suppressed by our rule:
```typescript
{ rule: '*', file: '__tests__/**/*' }
```

But it's NOT WORKING because `getRelativePath()` is failing to extract `__tests__/unit/TokenManager.test.ts` from the absolute path.

## THE FIX LOCATION
**File**: `src/security/audit/config/suppressions.ts`
**Function**: `getRelativePath()` (around line 399)
**Problem**: The regex patterns aren't matching CI paths correctly

## TEST THIS IMMEDIATELY
```javascript
// In suppressions.ts, add this debug:
console.log('Input path:', absolutePath);
console.log('Output path:', relativePath);

// You should see:
// Input: /home/runner/work/mcp-server/mcp-server/__tests__/unit/TokenManager.test.ts
// Output: __tests__/unit/TokenManager.test.ts
```

## REVIEWER'S MINDSET
They said: "This could be better code... let's improve that... make this higher quality"

This means:
- They see potential but want excellence
- Don't rush - make it robust
- Test edge cases
- Make it maintainable

## IF NOTHING ELSE, DO THIS
1. Fix `getRelativePath()` to handle `/home/runner/work/mcp-server/mcp-server/` paths
2. Run `npm test -- suppressions.test.ts` and fix failures
3. Push and check if CI findings drop from 172 to ~32

The entire PR success depends on path resolution working correctly!
