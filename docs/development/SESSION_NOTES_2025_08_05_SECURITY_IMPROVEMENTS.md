# Session Notes - August 5, 2025 - Security Improvements for GitHub Auth

## Session Context

**Time**: Afternoon session
**Branch**: `feature/github-auth-device-flow`  
**Focus**: Address all security audit issues and code review feedback for PR #464
**Starting Point**: PR had 2 security issues and multiple review recommendations

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Security Audit Issues Resolved ✅

**MEDIUM - Unicode Normalization**:
- Added `UnicodeValidator.normalize()` for all GitHub user data
- Validates usernames and display names
- Prevents homograph attacks

**LOW - Audit Logging**:
- Added comprehensive `SecurityMonitor.logSecurityEvent()` calls
- Covers device flow initiation, auth completion, token operations
- Provides complete audit trail

### 2. High Priority Review Items ✅

**Removed Hardcoded CLIENT_ID**:
- Eliminated fallback value `'Ov23li8KZDXQyFnXOVjn'`
- Now requires `DOLLHOUSE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` environment variable
- Added helpful error message for missing configuration

**Implemented Secure Token Storage**:
- Full AES-256-GCM encryption implementation
- Machine-specific encryption keys
- Stored in `~/.dollhouse/.auth/` with 0600 permissions
- Automatic fallback to environment variables

**Added Token Revocation**:
- `clearAuthentication()` removes stored tokens
- Clears API cache
- Note: GitHub device flow tokens don't have revocation API

### 3. Medium Priority Items ✅

**Comprehensive Test Coverage**:
- Created `GitHubAuthManager.test.ts` with 20+ test cases
- Created `tokenManager.storage.test.ts` with 10+ test cases
- Tests OAuth flow, errors, Unicode, cancellation, storage

**Improved Error Messages**:
- Added `getErrorMessageForStatus()` helper
- Maps HTTP codes to user-friendly messages
- Never exposes sensitive data or raw errors

**Cleanup on Shutdown**:
- Added graceful shutdown handlers (SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP)
- `cleanup()` method aborts active polling
- Clears cache and active operations

### 4. Additional Improvements ✅

**Network Retry Logic**:
- `fetchWithRetry()` with exponential backoff
- Handles transient network failures
- 3 retry attempts for reliability

**Abort Signal Support**:
- Polling cancellable via `AbortController`
- `waitWithAbort()` for interruptible delays
- Clean shutdown during active operations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Secure Storage Architecture
```
~/.dollhouse/.auth/
└── github_token.enc  (0600 permissions)
    ├── Salt (32 bytes)
    ├── IV (16 bytes)
    ├── Auth Tag (16 bytes)
    └── Encrypted Token (variable)
```

### Encryption Details
- Algorithm: AES-256-GCM
- Key Derivation: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- Passphrase: Machine-specific (hostname + username + app ID)
- Storage Format: Binary concatenation

### Error Handling Strategy
- Network errors: Retry with exponential backoff
- HTTP errors: User-friendly messages by status code
- Security errors: Logged but not exposed to users
- Debug info: Available in logs, not in user messages

## Build Issues Resolved

Fixed TypeScript compilation errors:
1. Import path case sensitivity (SecurityMonitor vs securityMonitor)
2. Security event types alignment with SecurityMonitor
3. Severity levels uppercase (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
4. Property name fixes (detectedIssues)

## Current Status

**PR #464 Status**:
- ✅ All security issues resolved
- ✅ All high/medium priority review items complete
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Comprehensive tests added
- ✅ Ready for review

**Remaining Items** (Low priority or external):
- Make timeouts configurable (enhancement)
- Test with real OAuth app (requires registration)
- Documentation updates (can be post-merge)

## Key Code Locations

### Modified Files
- `/src/auth/GitHubAuthManager.ts` - All security improvements
- `/src/security/tokenManager.ts` - Secure storage implementation
- `/src/index.ts` - Shutdown handlers

### New Test Files
- `/test/__tests__/unit/auth/GitHubAuthManager.test.ts`
- `/test/__tests__/unit/security/tokenManager.storage.test.ts`

## Security Improvements Summary

1. **No hardcoded credentials** - Everything via environment
2. **Encrypted token storage** - Military-grade encryption
3. **Unicode normalization** - Prevents homograph attacks
4. **Comprehensive audit trail** - All operations logged
5. **User-friendly errors** - No data leakage
6. **Graceful shutdown** - Clean resource cleanup
7. **Network resilience** - Handles transient failures
8. **Extensive testing** - 30+ security-focused tests

## Commits This Session

1. `35f1b6c` - Address all security audit issues and code review feedback
2. `5fdffed` - Resolve TypeScript compilation errors

## Next Steps

1. Wait for PR review and approval
2. Register OAuth app for testing
3. Update documentation with auth flow
4. Consider follow-up enhancements

## Lessons Learned

### Security Best Practices Applied
1. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security (encryption + permissions + validation)
2. **Fail Secure** - Errors default to denying access rather than allowing
3. **Least Privilege** - Tokens stored with minimal permissions (0600)
4. **Input Validation** - All external data validated and normalized
5. **Audit Everything** - Complete trail for security investigations

### Code Quality Improvements
1. **Error Context Balance** - Helpful messages without exposing implementation details
2. **Retry Logic** - Resilience against transient failures improves UX
3. **Resource Cleanup** - Proper shutdown handlers prevent resource leaks
4. **Type Safety** - Fixed all TypeScript errors for maintainability

### Testing Strategy Success
1. **Mock Everything** - Full control over test scenarios
2. **Edge Cases** - Tested timeouts, cancellations, corrupted data
3. **Security Scenarios** - Specific tests for each threat model
4. **Integration Points** - Tested interaction between components

## Architecture Decisions

### Why AES-256-GCM?
- Industry standard encryption
- Authenticated encryption (prevents tampering)
- Hardware acceleration on modern CPUs
- FIPS 140-2 approved algorithm

### Why Machine-Specific Keys?
- Tokens can't be copied between machines
- Adds additional security layer
- No need for user to manage passwords
- Automatic and transparent

### Why File Storage vs Keychain?
- Cross-platform compatibility (works on Linux)
- No external dependencies
- Easier to test and debug
- Can upgrade to keychain later

## Implementation Highlights

### Most Elegant Solution
The `waitWithAbort()` helper that makes any async operation cancellable:
```typescript
private async waitWithAbort(ms: number, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<void>
```
Simple, reusable, and solves a complex problem cleanly.

### Most Important Security Fix
Removing the hardcoded CLIENT_ID - even though it's "safe" for OAuth device flow, it couples the code to a specific app and creates confusion about security boundaries.

### Best User Experience Improvement
The retry logic with exponential backoff - users don't see transient network failures, making the auth flow feel more reliable and professional.

## Personal Notes

This was a fantastic example of how to properly address security feedback:
- Take every issue seriously (even "low" severity)
- Implement comprehensive fixes, not quick patches
- Document everything for future maintainers
- Test security scenarios specifically
- Balance security with user experience

The PR review process worked exactly as intended - catching issues early and driving quality improvements. The resulting code is significantly better than the initial implementation.
