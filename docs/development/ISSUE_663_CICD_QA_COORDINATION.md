# Issue #663 - CI/CD QA Integration Coordination Document

**Orchestrator**: Opus 4.1  
**Date**: August 22, 2025  
**Branch**: feature/qa-cicd-integration-663  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

## Mission Objective
Integrate QA automation scripts into the CI/CD pipeline to enable systematic testing and regression prevention.

## Current State
- âœ… PR #672 merged - Config centralization complete
- âœ… PR #676 created - Deprecated tools removed
- âœ… QA scripts working with proper tool discovery
- ðŸ“‹ Need to add QA to CI workflows

## Agent Assignments

### CI-AGENT-1: Workflow Implementation
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Model**: Sonnet 3.5  
**Task**: Create GitHub Actions workflow for QA tests  

**Specific Tasks**:
1. âœ… Create `.github/workflows/qa-tests.yml`
2. âœ… Configure to run on PR to develop branch
3. âœ… Set up proper environment variables
4. âœ… Add continue-on-error initially (non-blocking)
5. âœ… Configure test result reporting

**Files Created/Modified**:
- âœ… `.github/workflows/qa-tests.yml` (new)

**Implementation Details**:
- âœ… Runs only on develop branch PRs 
- âœ… Sets TEST_PERSONAS_DIR environment variable
- âœ… Uses Node 20.x with npm cache
- âœ… 10-minute timeout with continue-on-error: true
- âœ… Uploads test results as artifacts (JSON + logs)
- âœ… Creates PR comment summary with key metrics
- âœ… Includes environment validation and error handling
- âœ… Uses timeout command to prevent hanging
- âœ… Graceful handling of missing jq for result parsing

**Key Features**:
- Environment validation before running tests
- Proper artifact upload with retention policies  
- PR comment integration for visibility
- Non-blocking initially as requested
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Compatible with existing CI infrastructure

### TEST-AGENT-1: Test Environment Setup
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Model**: Sonnet 4  
**Task**: Ensure QA scripts work in CI environment  

**Specific Tasks**:
1. âœ… Update qa-test-runner.js for CI compatibility
2. âœ… Add CI detection logic
3. âœ… Configure proper paths for CI
4. âœ… Add error handling for CI-specific issues
5. âœ… Ensure cleanup happens even on failure

**Files Modified**:
- âœ… `scripts/qa-test-runner.js` - Added CI environment detection, proper cleanup, directory management
- âœ… `scripts/qa-utils.js` - Added CI detection utilities, directory creation, CI-specific functions
- âœ… `test-config.js` - Added CI-specific timeouts and test settings
- âœ… `scripts/qa-simple-test.js` - Updated for CI compatibility
- âœ… `scripts/qa-direct-test.js` - Updated for CI compatibility

**Implementation Details**:
- âœ… CI environment detection via multiple environment variables (CI, GITHUB_ACTIONS, etc.)
- âœ… Increased timeouts in CI (doubled for most operations)
- âœ… Proper docs/QA directory creation with CI-aware error handling
- âœ… Test skipping logic for tests requiring GitHub tokens or file system access
- âœ… Enhanced error reporting with CI-specific debugging information
- âœ… Cleanup operations that run even on test failures
- âœ… Environment metadata in test reports (CI vs Local)
- âœ… Graceful handling of missing TEST_PERSONAS_DIR in CI

**Key Requirements Met**:
- âœ… Detect CI environment (GitHub Actions and other CI systems)
- âœ… Use appropriate paths for CI (TEST_PERSONAS_DIR handling)
- âœ… Handle missing personas directory gracefully
- âœ… Clean up test artifacts with try/catch in finally blocks

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Integration (TODAY)
1. CI-AGENT-1 creates basic workflow file
2. TEST-AGENT-1 ensures scripts are CI-compatible
3. Test on a draft PR
4. Fix any issues found

### Phase 2: Enhanced Reporting (FUTURE)
- Add test result parsing
- Create status badges
- Add performance tracking
- Set up failure notifications

### Phase 3: Full Integration (FUTURE)
- Remove continue-on-error
- Make tests blocking for merge
- Add to release workflow
- Set up scheduled runs

## Success Criteria
- [ ] QA tests run on every PR to develop
- [ ] Test results visible in GitHub Actions
- [ ] Scripts handle CI environment properly
- [ ] No impact on existing workflows
- [ ] Clear documentation added

## Known Constraints
1. TEST_PERSONAS_DIR must be set in CI
2. GitHub token needed for some tests
3. May need to skip certain tests in CI
4. Performance may vary in CI vs local

## Agent Communication Protocol

### Status Updates
Agents should update their section with:
- STARTED: Beginning work
- IN PROGRESS: Active development
- BLOCKED: Issue encountered (describe)
- COMPLETE: Task finished
- HANDOFF: Context limit approaching

- [x] Added 10-minute timeout protection
- [x] Configured artifact uploads for JSON results
- [x] Added PR comment integration
- [x] Included comprehensive error handling
- [x] Updated coordination document with completion status

### TEST-AGENT-1 Progress  
- [x] Updated qa-test-runner.js with CI environment detection
- [x] Added CI-specific configuration and error handling
- [x] Implemented proper cleanup operations with try/catch/finally
- [x] Enhanced qa-utils.js with CI detection utilities
- [x] Updated test-config.js with CI-specific timeouts (doubled)

```

### Blockers
Document any blockers immediately:
```markdown
### BLOCKER: [Agent Name]
Issue: Description
Needs: What's required to unblock
```

## Current Working Branch
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/qa-cicd-integration-663
```

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Test locally first
node scripts/qa-test-runner.js

# Test in CI-like environment
CI=true TEST_PERSONAS_DIR=/tmp/test-personas node scripts/qa-test-runner.js

# Check workflow syntax
act -n  # Uses nektos/act to test locally
```

## References
- Issue #663: Original requirements
- PR #662: QA framework that needs integration
- PR #671: Tool validation implementation
- PR #672: Config centralization

## Notes for Agents
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Test everything locally first
- Document all decisions
- Update this coordination doc frequently
- If approaching context limit, document handoff clearly
