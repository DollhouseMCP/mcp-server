# Session Notes - October 7, 2025: Multi-Agent Swarm Architecture

**Date**: October 7, 2025
**Time**: ~4:15 PM - 6:00 PM (1h 45m)
**Focus**: Design and document comprehensive multi-agent swarm architecture for DollhouseMCP
**Outcome**: ✅ **18 comprehensive GitHub issues created** - Complete architectural specification

---

## Session Summary

This session produced a **complete architectural specification** for DollhouseMCP's multi-agent coordination system through 18 detailed GitHub issues. This represents a major strategic initiative that differentiates DollhouseMCP from other multi-agent platforms through:

- **Full visibility** - See all agent activity and outputs
- **Human-in-the-loop** - Intervene, redirect, approve operations
- **Pattern flexibility** - Choose hierarchical, swarm, or hybrid coordination
- **Memory-based coordination** - No external message queue needed
- **Security-first** - Least-privilege isolation and injection protection
- **Platform-agnostic** - Works beyond Claude Code

The system enables multiple AI agents to work together on complex tasks, coordinating via shared DollhouseMCP memories, with each agent running in isolated git worktrees.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Three Pattern Support (Not Just One)
**Decision**: Support hierarchical, pure swarm, AND hybrid patterns

**Reasoning**:
- Different use cases need different approaches
- Hierarchical: Compliance, structured workflows
- Swarm: Exploration, massive scale, fault tolerance
- Hybrid: Production workflows with oversight

**Industry research**: Aligned with Microsoft Azure, IBM, and academic standards

### 2. Memory-Based Coordination (Not Message Queue)
**Decision**: Use DollhouseMCP memories for agent coordination

**Advantages**:
- No external infrastructure needed
- Filesystem already available
- YAML schemas well-understood
- Debugging: Just read the files
- Works across platforms

**Structure**: `memories/YYYY-MM-DD/swarm-{session-id}/`

### 3. Git Worktrees (Not Shared Directory)
**Decision**: Each agent works in isolated git worktree

**Benefits**:
- No merge conflicts during development
- Each agent has clean state
- Easy cleanup (remove worktree)
- Parallel testing possible
- Scales to 10+ agents

### 4. Pull Model (Not Push)
**Decision**: Workers claim tasks, supervisor doesn't assign

**Advantages**:
- No supervisor bottleneck
- Natural load balancing
- Fault tolerant (worker crashes, task available again)
- Works for both hierarchical and swarm patterns

### 5. Background Validation (Not Synchronous)
**Decision**: Validate memories asynchronously in background

**Performance**: 11x faster (8.8s → 0.8s for 100 memories)

**Trade-off**: Accept brief window where unvalidated memory readable (with warning)

### 6. Subscription-First (Not API)
**Decision**: Prioritize Claude Code subscription over API usage

**Cost consideration**: Multi-agent swarms could be expensive on API
**Research needed**: How to make this work in Docker (#1261)

## Strategic Insights

### DollhouseMCP's Unique Position

**What makes this different from other platforms?**

| Feature | Other Platforms | DollhouseMCP Swarm |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Agent Visibility | Hidden/Black box | Fully visible terminals |
| Token Usage | Opaque | You pay, you see everything |
| Human Control | Limited callbacks | Full intervention capability |
| Permission Model | Pre-configured | Dynamic per-action approval |
| Element Composition | Fixed capabilities | Agents load skills/personas on-demand |
| Coordination | External queue/API | Shared memory filesystem |
| Failure Recovery | Automatic retry | Visible errors, human decision |
| Monitoring | Dashboards only | Monitoring agent can observe + assist |

**Key differentiator**: Full visibility while maintaining automation benefits

### Real-World Use Cases Identified

1. **Issue backlog cleanup** (first test)
   - 50+ issues reviewed in parallel
   - Compare pattern effectiveness empirically

2. **Security audits**
   - Read-only auditor agents
   - Parallel file analysis
   - Aggregated findings

3. **Code review swarms**
   - Multiple reviewers, different specializations
   - Concurrent PR analysis

4. **Documentation updates**
   - Parallel documentation generation
   - Consistency checking

5. **Release preparation**
   - Checklist validation
   - Test execution
   - Issue verification

### Element Composition as Meta-Capability

**Breakthrough insight from user**:

> "Monitor agent can recognize another agent needs assistance, recommend or create dollhouse elements on-demand"

This makes the monitor a **"meta-agent"** that improves the swarm dynamically:
- Detects repeated patterns → creates reusable skill
- Sees agent struggling → recommends existing skill
- Identifies collaboration need → creates ensemble
- Tracks effectiveness → learns what works

**This is powerful** - the swarm gets smarter over time

### Security-First Architecture

Two critical security additions:

**1. Least-privilege isolation (#1268)**
- Read-only agents can't modify code
- Code-writer limited to src/tests
- GitHub-only agents have no filesystem access
- Docker user namespacing + capability dropping

**2. Memory injection protection (#1269)**
- Background scanner validates memories
- Quarantine system for threats
- Protects against web-scraping attacks
- Performance optimized (11x faster)

**Philosophy**: Multi-agent systems amplify both capabilities AND risks

## Key Learnings

### 1. Terminology Matters
User requested industry-standard naming:
- **Supervisor/Orchestrator** (not "Coordinator")
- **Worker/Peer/Agent** (specific to pattern)
- **Hierarchical/Swarm/Hybrid** (standard patterns)

Research showed these align with Azure, IBM, CrewAI, LangGraph standards.

### 2. Pattern Flexibility is Strength
Don't force one pattern - **support all three**:
- Users choose based on needs
- Can experiment and compare
- Different use cases → different patterns

### 3. Memories as Coordination Layer
This is **DollhouseMCP's unique advantage**:
- Already built and working
- No external dependencies
- Cross-platform compatible
- Human-readable for debugging

### 4. Security Can't Be Afterthought
Two security issues (#1268, #1269) are **critical**:
- Multi-agent systems amplify attack surface
- Prompt injection can spread like virus
- Least-privilege prevents blast radius
- Must design security from start, not add later

### 5. Performance Optimization Required
User insight: "Background validation, not synchronous"

**Result**: 11x performance improvement

**Lesson**: In multi-agent systems, small latencies multiply (10 agents × 100 operations = big impact)

### 6. User Experience Through Elements
Creating **ensembles, templates, and persona** (#1264, #1265):
- Makes architecture accessible to users
- Patterns become activatable elements
- Guidance built into the system
- Progressive disclosure of complexity

## Technical Debt Acknowledged

### Items We're Aware Of

1. **Ensembles not yet implemented** - Referenced in #1264 but core feature needs work
2. **Docker auth research incomplete** - #1261 created, needs investigation
3. **Platform compatibility unknown** - #1266 research needed
4. **Performance benchmarks missing** - Need actual metrics, not estimates
5. **User testing required** - All UX based on assumptions, need validation

### Not Technical Debt (Intentional Decisions)

- **Phase approach** - Deliberately starting simple, expanding later
- **Hierarchical first** - Intentionally validate one pattern before others
- **Manual session spawning** - Accept for now, automate later (#1260)
