## Work Completed

### 1. PR 1401 SonarCloud Fixes (7:30 AM - 7:55 AM)

**Context**: PR 1401 (converter UX improvements) had 8 SonarCloud issues + 1 security audit issue blocking merge.

**Issues Fixed**:

#### Test File (`converter.test.ts`)
1. **S7721 (MAJOR)** - Moved `createZip()` async function to outer scope for better performance
2. **S2004 (CRITICAL x2)** - Reduced function nesting by extracting helper to top level
3. **S3735 (CRITICAL)** - Removed confusing `void` operator, properly handle promise
4. **S1854 (MAJOR x2)** - Removed useless assignments to `zipStats` and `stats` variables

#### Source File (`convert.ts`)
5. **S2486 (MINOR)** - Enhanced exception handling in cleanup catch block to log error details
6. **S3776 (CRITICAL)** - Reduced cognitive complexity 16‚Üí15 by extracting `cleanupTempDirectory()` function
7. **DMCP-SEC-004 (MEDIUM SECURITY)** - Implemented `UnicodeValidator.normalize()` on all user inputs:
   - Input file paths
   - Output directory paths
   - HOME environment variable
   - Prevents homograph attacks via lookalike characters

**Files Modified**:
- `test/__tests__/unit/converter.test.ts` - Test improvements
- `src/cli/convert.ts` - Security fixes and complexity reduction

**Verification**:
- ‚úÖ All 23 converter tests passing
- ‚úÖ TypeScript build successful
- ‚úÖ All SonarCloud issues addressed
- ‚úÖ Security vulnerability patched

**Commit**: 5cfa5a2f
**Merged**: 7f5081cc to `develop` branch
**PR**: https://github.com/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server/pull/1401

### 2. Documentation Commits (8:00 AM - 8:10 AM)

**Action**: Committed accumulated session notes and development documentation to mcp-server repo.

**Files Added** (28 files, 10,284 insertions):
- 24 session notes (Oct 17-25, 2025)
  - Release processes (v1.9.18, v1.9.19, v1.9.22)
  - CI/CD improvements and MCP Registry publishing
  - PR work (1388, 1389, 1400, 1401)
  - Tool optimization and security fixes

- Development documentation:
  - Singleton pattern explanation

**Special Handling**:
- Moved `SESSION_NOTES_2025-10-18-ANTHROPIC-SKILLS-INVESTIGATION.md` to business repo (contains competitive analysis)
- Used `--no-verify` flag with explicit permission for documentation-only commit

**Commits**:
- mcp-server: 98df8a18, 873d9a8f
- business: ac1927f

### 3. Skill-Converter Creation (8:10 AM - 8:25 AM)

**Context**: Need bidirectional conversion between Claude Skills (Anthropic) and DollhouseMCP Skills.

**Decision**: Create ONE skill for both directions with automatic format detection.

**Rationale**:
- Claude Skills = Anthropic Skills (official name vs common usage)
- LLM can detect format automatically (ZIP, SKILL.md, YAML frontmatter)
- Follows DollhouseMCP's "intelligent adapter" pattern
- Reduces cognitive load - one skill for any conversion

**Skill Created**: `skill-converter.md`
- Bidirectional conversion (Claude ‚Üî DollhouseMCP)
- Automatic format detection
- Natural language triggers: "convert skill", "import claude skill", "export skill"
- Comprehensive examples for both directions
- Documents security features (ZIP bombs, Unicode attacks)
- Integration workflow (reload/activate after import)

**Key Features**:
- Uses "Claude Skills" as primary term (with "Anthropic Skills" recognized)
- Auto-detects ZIP files, directories, .md files
- Provides both `from-anthropic` and `to-anthropic` commands
- Includes dry-run, verbose, and report options
- Documents roundtrip conversion capabilities

**Location**: `~/.dollhouse/portfolio/skills/skill-converter.md`
**Status**: ‚úÖ Created, loaded, verified (75 skills total)

### 4. Portfolio Sync to GitHub (8:25 AM - 8:35 AM)

**Context**: Large local portfolio (291 elements) not synced to GitHub in a while.

**Action**: Synced all elements EXCEPT memories to GitHub portfolio.

**Elements Synced**: 251 total
- ‚úÖ 75 Personas
- ‚úÖ 88 Skills (including new skill-converter!)
- ‚úÖ 54 Templates
- ‚úÖ 34 Agents

**Excluded**: 35 Memories (kept local only per request)

**Sync Details**:
- Direction: push (local ‚Üí GitHub)
- Mode: additive (only adds, never deletes)
- Result: 100% success (251/251)

**Portfolio URL**: https://github.com/mickdarling/dollhouse-portfolio

### 5. Collection Submission Planning (8:35 AM - 8:45 AM)

**Context**: Review all 251 portfolio elements for submission to public DollhouseMCP collection.

**Document Created**: `COLLECTION_SUBMISSION_PLAN.md`

**Analysis Results**:

#### ‚úÖ Ready for Collection: 165 elements
- Personas: 45 (dollhouse-expert, sonar-guardian, screenwriting suite, fictional characters)
- Skills: 55 (skill-converter ‚≠ê, document creation suite, security tools)
- Templates: 42 (GitHub issue templates, screenwriting templates, security reports)
- Agents: 23 (mcp-registry-publisher, sonar-sweep-agent, integration testers)

#### üîí Personal/PII: 12 elements
- alex-sterling (Mick's authentic writing style)
- mick-darling-authentic-voice template
- speak-in-my-voice skill
- claude-code-vscode-best-practices ("working with Mick")

#### üß™ Experimental: 46 elements
- Swarm system (orchestrator, workers, monitoring)
- Forensic analysis personas
- Multi-agent plan coordination
- Test/experimental features

#### üîç Needs Review: 28 elements
- Mostly test elements (test-*, roundtrip-*, concurrent)
- Generic named skills to verify content

**High-Priority Submissions**:
- skill-converter (NEW - showcases interoperability)
- Document creation suite (docx-creator, pdf-creator, pptx-creator)
- Domain-specific skill collections (linkedin-*, reddit-*, obs-*)
- Screenwriting suite (comprehensive example set)
- Security validation tools

**Recommendations**:
- Submit 165 ready elements to main collection
- Create experimental folder for 46 experimental items
- Remove/don't submit test elements
- Review 12 personal/PII items before any action

**Document Location**: `docs/development/COLLECTION_SUBMISSION_PLAN.md`
**Commit**: 2ce44b0c

## Key Learnings

### 1. GitFlow Guardian --no-verify Usage
- Established policy: Only use `--no-verify` with explicit permission
- Appropriate for documentation-only commits (historical records)
- Must ask for permission each time this situation arises
- Not to be used as general practice

### 2. SonarCloud Cognitive Complexity
- Extracting helper functions is the most effective way to reduce complexity
- Moving nested functions to outer scope improves both performance and readability
- The `cleanupTempDirectory()` extraction reduced complexity from 16‚Üí15

### 3. Security Best Practices
- Always use `UnicodeValidator.normalize()` instead of built-in `.normalize()`
- UnicodeValidator detects homograph attacks, built-in doesn't
- Apply to ALL user input: file paths, environment variables, output directories

### 4. DollhouseMCP Skill Design Philosophy
- Prefer ONE intelligent skill over multiple specialized skills
- Let the LLM detect context and choose the right action
- Follows "intelligent adapter" pattern - smart routing, not rigid rules
- Better UX: "convert this skill" vs "use to-anthropic or from-anthropic?"

### 5. Portfolio Organization Strategy
- GitHub portfolio serves as backup and public showcase
- Memories stay local (personal/contextual)
- Need regular sync to keep GitHub current
- Collection submission requires careful PII review

---

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Review collection submission plan** - Check Personal/PII and Needs Review categories
2. **Clean up test elements** - Remove from portfolio if not needed
3. **Submit ready elements** - Use submit_collection_content for high-priority items
4. **Test skill-converter** - Do a real conversion to verify it works

### Future Sessions
1. Create experimental folder structure in collection
2. Submit 165 ready elements in batches
3. Document submission tracking (what's submitted, what's pending)
4. Consider creating curated collections (security suite, screenwriting suite, etc.)

## Decisions Made

1. **Bidirectional skill-converter**: One skill for both directions with auto-detection
2. **Claude Skills terminology**: Use "Claude Skills" as primary (official name), recognize "Anthropic Skills"
3. **Portfolio sync scope**: All elements except memories
4. **Collection submission approach**: Create detailed plan first, submit in next session
5. **Documentation commits**: Acceptable to use --no-verify for historical documentation
