# ReDoS Protection Implementation Status - July 12, 2025 12:32 PM

## âœ… Completed
1. **RegexValidator utility created** - Full implementation with timeout protection
2. **Security infrastructure added** - SecurityError classes for proper error handling  
3. **5 validators updated** - All using RegexValidator for safe regex execution
4. **Comprehensive test suite** - 28 tests covering all ReDoS scenarios
5. **Code committed** - All changes saved to branch `implement-redos-protection`

## ðŸ”„ Current Issues
1. **Test timeout problem** - RegexValidator tests are timing out when run
   - Tests may have infinite loop or blocking issue
   - Need to investigate test framework compatibility
   - Other security tests work fine

2. **Build succeeds** - TypeScript compilation works without errors

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
1. Debug test timeout issue - possibly related to jest mocking or async handling
2. Run full test suite once timeout is fixed
3. Create PR for Issue #163
4. Move on to Issue #165 (input length validation)

## ðŸ’¡ Technical Notes
- RegexValidator is fully implemented and integrated
- Uses performance.now() for accurate timing
- SecurityMonitor integration uses existing event types
- All validators maintain backward compatibility

The implementation is complete but blocked on test execution issues.
