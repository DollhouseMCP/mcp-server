# Session Notes - October 14, 2025 (Evening)

**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Time**: 6:20 PM - 8:00 PM (~100 minutes)
**Focus**: Complete commercial licensing infrastructure and prepare for MCP Registry submission
**Outcome**: ✅ Dual licensing framework complete and merged

---

## Session Summary

Completed comprehensive dual licensing infrastructure for DollhouseMCP, building on morning session's professional email setup and org profile updates. Created commercial licensing framework with expert review (A- grade), updated all relevant files, and merged changes to both mcp-server and .github repositories.

**Key Achievement**: DollhouseMCP now has production-ready dual licensing infrastructure (AGPL-3.0 + Commercial) with strong legal protection, ready for MCP Registry marketplace publication.

---

## Completed Work

### 1. Commercial License Framework (COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md) ✅

**File Created**: `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` (175 lines)

**Key Sections Implemented**:

#### Top-Level Protection
- **Non-binding disclaimer** at top - protects until written agreement executed
- Clear statement: "This document describes our commercial licensing program but does not itself constitute a binding commercial license"

#### Dual Licensing Overview
- AGPL-3.0 for personal/educational/open source (free)
- Commercial License for proprietary use (paid)
- Clear triggers for when commercial license needed

#### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
- **Contributors retain copyright** ✅
- Contributors grant dual-license rights to DollhouseMCP
- Transparent explanation matching industry practice (Qt, MySQL)
- Explained in both FAQ and dedicated section

#### Pricing Model
- **Case-by-case negotiation** appropriate for emerging project
- Internal use vs redistribution distinction
- OEM/ISV/resale higher pricing tier
- Professional justification for flexible pricing

#### Warranty & Liability Protection
- **AGPL-3.0**: "AS IS" with no warranty
- **Commercial**: Limited warranty negotiated per deal
- **Limitation of Liability**: Caps consequential damages for all users
- **Indemnification**: Negotiated provisions for commercial customers

#### Legal Framework
- **Jurisdiction**: Commonwealth of Massachusetts (Delaware incorporation pending)
- **Export Control**: User responsibility clearly stated
- **Trademark**: DollhouseMCP™ (unregistered mark notation)
- **Contact**: contact@dollhousemcp.com for commercial inquiries

#### Software Licensing Expert Review

**Grade Received**: A- (92/100)

**Strengths Identified**:
- Crystal clear trigger conditions for commercial license
- Strong legal protection with proper disclaimers
- Transparent CLA matching industry standards (Qt, MySQL)
- Developer-friendly language
- More transparent than MySQL
- More developer-friendly than Qt
- Better clarity than historical MongoDB

**Why Not A+**:
- No formal CLA document yet (FAQ disclosure sufficient for now)
- No license agreement template yet (needed when first customer appears)
- Minor enhancements possible (severability clause, network copyleft explanation)

**Risk Level**: LOW
**Business Viability**: HIGH

### 2. README.md Updates ✅

**Changes Made**:

#### License Badge Updated
- **From**: `License: AGPL-3.0`
- **To**: `License: AGPL-3.0 | Commercial` with link to COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md

#### New Dual Licensing Section
Added prominent section in License area:
- Overview of both license options
- Clear commercial license triggers
- Contact email: contact@dollhousemcp.com
- Link to COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md for complete details

#### Contributor License Agreement Enhanced
Updated CLA section with:
- Contributors retain copyright (bold emphasis)
- Grant dual-license rights to DollhouseMCP
- References to Qt and MySQL as industry precedent
- Transparency about funding model

#### AGPL-3.0 Restrictions Clarified
- Updated "You CANNOT" section
- Changed from "Resell commercially" to "Use in closed-source proprietary software (requires Commercial License)"
- More accurate representation of dual licensing

---

### 3. package.json Updates ✅

**Changes Made**:

#### Author Email Updated
- **From**: `email: "mick@mickdarling.com"`
- **To**: `email: "mick@dollhousemcp.com"`

#### License Field Updated (Review Feedback)
- **From**: `"license": "AGPL-3.0"`
- **To**: `"license": "SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE"`
- Standard NPM convention for dual licensing
- Points users to LICENSE file for complete information

---

### 4. LICENSE File Enhanced ✅

**Critical Addition**: Dual Licensing Notice

Added prominent notice after copyright, before AGPL text:

```
DUAL LICENSING NOTICE:
DollhouseMCP is available under dual licensing:
1. AGPL-3.0 (this file) - Free for personal, educational, and open source projects
2. Commercial License - For proprietary/commercial use without AGPL obligations

For commercial licensing inquiries, see COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md or contact:
contact@dollhousemcp.com

Unless you have a separate commercial license agreement, this software is licensed
under the terms of the AGPL-3.0 as stated below.
```

**Why This Matters**:
- GitHub reads LICENSE file for badge display
- Third-party sites (npm, libraries.io) read this file
- Addresses "no license" reports from some sites
- Ensures anyone reading LICENSE sees both options
- GitHub will still correctly detect as AGPL-3.0 (the default license)

---

### 5. Organization Profile Updated (.github repo) ✅

**PR #1**: Merged to .github/main

**Changes from Morning Session** (now pushed and merged):
- Professional contact emails (mick@, support@, contact@dollhousemcp.com)
- Modern messaging shift to "customization elements"
- Real-world examples (Murder Mystery, home organization, voice training)
- Dual licensing information added
- Updated mission statement
- "Build once, use everywhere" value proposition

**Branch**: `feature/update-org-profile-professional-contact`
**Status**: Merged to main, live at github.com/DollhouseMCP

## Technical Details

### Dual Licensing Model Structure

**Three-Tier Documentation**:
1. **LICENSE** - AGPL-3.0 full text + dual licensing notice
2. **COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md** - Complete commercial licensing info
3. **README.md** - High-level overview with links

**NPM Package Structure**:
- `package.json` license field: "SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE"
- LICENSE file distributed with package
- COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md distributed with package
- README.md explains both options

### Legal Protection Layers

**Layer 1: Not-a-binding-license disclaimer** (top of COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md)
- Protects until written agreement
- Critical for preventing implied licenses

**Layer 2: Warranty disclaimers**
- AGPL: "AS IS" (standard open source)
- Commercial: Negotiated per deal

**Layer 3: Limitation of liability**
- Caps consequential damages
- Covers both AGPL and commercial users
- Standard software industry protection

**Layer 4: CLA transparency**
- Contributors retain copyright
- Grant dual-license rights
- Industry standard practice

### Contact Infrastructure

**Professional Emails** (Google Workspace Business Starter):
- **mick@dollhousemcp.com** - Founder, technical questions
- **support@dollhousemcp.com** - User support, issues
- **contact@dollhousemcp.com** - General inquiries, commercial licensing

**All configured and tested** ✅

## Lessons Learned

### License Field Best Practices

**Discovery**: Third-party sites were reporting "no license"
**Root Cause**: LICENSE file didn't mention dual licensing
**Solution**: Added dual licensing notice to LICENSE file
**Standard**: "SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE" in package.json for dual licensing

### GitHub License Detection

**How It Works**:
- GitHub reads LICENSE file in root directory
- Detects license type from file content
- Displays badge on repo main page
- Third-party sites also read this file

**Our Approach**:
- LICENSE contains AGPL-3.0 full text (GitHub badge shows this)
- Added dual licensing notice at top (human-readable)
- GitHub still correctly detects as AGPL-3.0
- Anyone reading file sees both options

### CLA in FAQ vs Separate Document

**Decision**: CLA terms in FAQ section initially
**Reasoning**:
- Transparent and discoverable
- Matches industry practice for documentation
- Formal CLA document can follow later (recommended at 5+ regular contributors)
- Current contributors: 1 advisor (no code used directly), 1 aware contributor

**Future**: Create formal CLA document when contributor base grows
