# Session Notes - September 22, 2025 - Test Isolation Fix
## 8:00 PM - 8:12 PM EST

### Session Overview
Emergency fix session to address critical test failures introduced in PR #1093. Tests were writing to the real user's `~/.dollhouse/portfolio/capability-index.yaml` file, which could corrupt production data.

### Context
- Started with PR #1093 (Cross-element relationships) merged successfully
- CI showed 6 failing tests on develop branch
- Initial attempt to fix with jest mocks failed due to ES module incompatibility

### Issues Discovered

#### 1. Initial Test Failures
- PR #1093 added incorrect jest mocks that don't work with ES modules
- `jest.requireActual` is not compatible with ES module context
- Tests were failing with "jest is not defined" errors

#### 2. Critical File System Pollution Issue
**CRITICAL**: Tests were writing to the real user's dollhouse directory!
- EnhancedIndexManager tests were using `process.env.HOME`
- Tests were modifying `~/.dollhouse/portfolio/capability-index.yaml`
- Could corrupt user's actual capability index data
- Race conditions possible with parallel test execution

### Solutions Implemented

#### PR #1094: Remove Incorrect Mocks
- Removed problematic `jest.mock` calls
- Fixed jest import issues (needed `@jest/globals`)
- Tests still timing out but no longer throwing module errors

#### Test Isolation Implementation
Created comprehensive test isolation system:

**test-setup.ts utilities:**
```typescript
- setupTestEnvironment(): Creates unique temp directory per test
- cleanupTestEnvironment(): Cleans up and restores original HOME
- resetSingletons(): Resets singleton instances between tests
```

**Key features:**
- Each test gets unique temp directory: `os.tmpdir()/dollhouse-test-{timestamp}-{random}`
- HOME environment variable overridden during tests
- Proper cleanup prevents disk space issues
- All singleton instances reset to prevent state leakage

**Updated test files:**
- EnhancedIndexManager.test.ts
- VerbTriggerManager.test.ts
- RelationshipManager.test.ts

### Technical Details

#### Why Initial Mocks Failed
```javascript
// This doesn't work in ES modules:
jest.mock('fs', () => ({
  ...jest.requireActual('fs'),  // ‚ùå require not defined
  readFileSync: jest.fn()
}));
```

#### Singleton Reset Challenge
- Originally tried using `require()` - doesn't work in ES modules
- Solution: Dynamic imports with async/await
```typescript
const { EnhancedIndexManager } = await import('...');
(EnhancedIndexManager as any).instance = null;
```

### Current Status

#### What's Fixed
‚úÖ Tests no longer write to real user files
‚úÖ Each test has isolated file system
‚úÖ Proper cleanup after tests
‚úÖ No more module errors

#### What Still Needs Work
‚ö†Ô∏è Tests are timing out (different issue)
‚ö†Ô∏è Need to investigate why tests take so long
‚ö†Ô∏è May need to implement proper test doubles

### Lessons Learned

1. **Never trust test defaults** - Always verify where tests write data
2. **ES modules require different mocking strategies** - Can't use traditional jest mocks
3. **Test isolation is critical** - Tests must never touch production data
4. **Singletons need special handling** - Must reset between tests to avoid state leakage

### Code Quality Notes

The fix demonstrates several best practices:
- Defensive programming (checking for temp dir before cleanup)
- Unique identifiers prevent conflicts
- Proper async/await handling throughout
- Clear separation of concerns in test utilities

### Security Implications

This was a **critical security issue**:
- Tests could corrupt user data
- Tests could expose sensitive information
- Parallel execution could cause race conditions
- No audit trail of test modifications

### Next Steps

1. Investigate test timeout issues
2. Consider implementing test doubles instead of real instances
3. Add CI check to ensure tests use temp directories
4. Document test isolation requirements
5. Consider migration to Vitest for better ES module support

### Pull Requests

- **PR #1093**: ‚úÖ Merged - Cross-element relationships implementation
- **PR #1094**: üîÑ Open - Remove incorrect jest mocks and add test isolation

### Review Feedback

Claude's review of PR #1094 correctly identified:
- File system pollution risks
- Need for temporary directories
- Test isolation concerns
- Recommendations for proper test architecture

### Session Summary

Critical fix implemented to prevent tests from corrupting user data. While tests still have timeout issues, the immediate danger of file system pollution has been eliminated. The solution provides a robust framework for test isolation that should be applied to all integration tests going forward.
