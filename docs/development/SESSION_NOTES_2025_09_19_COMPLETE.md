# Session Notes - September 19, 2025 - Memory Fixes & v1.9.3/v1.9.4 Releases

**Date**: September 19, 2025
**Time**: Full Day Session
**Context**: Fixing memory element support issues across multiple releases
**Outcome**: Successfully released v1.9.3 and v1.9.4 to fix all memory-related bugs

## Executive Summary

Today's session focused on fixing critical memory element support issues in DollhouseMCP. We discovered that memory elements were completely broken in v1.9.2, showing "Unknown element type 'memories'" errors. Through two releases (v1.9.3 and v1.9.4), we:

1. **v1.9.3**: Fixed the MCP tool handlers to recognize memory elements
2. **v1.9.4**: Fixed the display bug where all memories showed as "Unnamed Memory"

Both releases are now live on npm and GitHub, with full memory support restored.

## Session Timeline

### Morning: v1.9.3 - Memory Element MCP Support

#### Problem Discovered
- User reported "Unknown element type 'memories'" errors
- Memory tools were completely non-functional
- All memory-related commands failed

#### Root Cause
The Memory infrastructure was fully implemented, but the MCP tool handlers in `src/index.ts` were missing the switch cases for memory elements.

#### Solution (PR #1028)
Added Memory case statements to 8 MCP tool methods:
1. `listElements()` - Lists memories with retention policy
2. `activateElement()` - Activates memory elements
3. `getActiveElements()` - Shows active memories
4. `deactivateElement()` - Deactivates memories
5. `getElementDetails()` - Shows memory details
6. `reloadElements()` - Reloads from portfolio
7. `createElement()` - Creates new memories
8. `editElement()` - Edits memory properties

#### v1.9.3 Release Process
1. Created release branch `release/1.9.3`
2. Updated version in package.json
3. Updated CHANGELOG with fixes
4. PR #1028 merged to main
5. Tagged v1.9.3 and pushed
6. Published to npm
7. GitHub release created automatically

### Evening: v1.9.4 - Memory Name Display Fix

#### New Problem Discovered
After v1.9.3, memories were recognized but all displayed as "Unnamed Memory" when listing.

#### Investigation
- Found that memory files are `.yaml` format in date folders
- Some legacy `.md` files in root (templates/schemas, not actual memories)
- `MemoryManager` had two bugs:
  1. Was looking for `.yaml` files correctly
  2. BUT was parsing metadata incorrectly

#### Root Cause (PR #1030)
The `parseMemoryFile()` method was looking for `parsed.metadata` but `SecureYamlParser` returns the YAML frontmatter in `parsed.data` property.

#### Solution
1. Fixed metadata parsing to use `parsed.data` instead of `parsed.metadata`
2. Added `parseRetentionDays()` helper for flexible retention formats
3. Ensured only `.yaml/.yml` extensions are accepted (no `.md`)
4. Added regression test to prevent recurrence

#### v1.9.4 Release Process
1. Created fix on branch `fix/memory-listing-file-extension`
2. PR #1030 created and reviewed
3. Added regression test per reviewer recommendation
4. Merged to develop
5. Created release branch `release/1.9.4`
6. PR #1031 merged to main
7. Tagged v1.9.4 and pushed
8. Published to npm (auto by workflow)
9. GitHub release created (auto by workflow)

## Technical Details

### Memory File Structure
```yaml
# Located in: ~/.dollhouse/portfolio/memories/YYYY-MM-DD/*.yaml
metadata:
  name: "Memory Name"
  description: "Description"
  storageBackend: "file"
  retentionDays: 30
  privacyLevel: "private"
data:
  entries: []
```

### Legacy Files Found
In `~/.dollhouse/portfolio/memories/`:
- `conversation-history.md` - Template/schema file
- `learning-progress.md` - Template/schema file
- `project-context.md` - Template/schema file
- `mick-darling-profile.md` - Template/schema file

These are NOT actual memory files, just templates from early development.

### Key Code Changes

#### v1.9.3 - Added to src/index.ts:
```typescript
case 'memories':
case ElementType.MEMORY: {
  const memories = await this.memoryManager.list();
  // Handle memory operations...
}
```

#### v1.9.4 - Fixed in MemoryManager.ts:
```typescript
// BEFORE (broken):
const yamlData = parsed.metadata || {};

// AFTER (fixed):
const yamlData = parsed.data || {};
```

## Testing Performed

### v1.9.3 Testing
- Created test memory `test-memory-v193`
- Successfully activated and deactivated
- Verified all CRUD operations work
- Confirmed persistence across operations

### v1.9.4 Testing
- All 90 memory tests pass
- Added regression test for name parsing
- Verified names display correctly
- Confirmed only `.yaml` files are processed

## Current State

### What's Working
✅ Memory elements fully supported in MCP tools
✅ Memory names display correctly
✅ All CRUD operations functional
✅ Retention policies work
✅ Both v1.9.3 and v1.9.4 published to npm

### Known Issues
- Legacy `.md` files in memories directory (templates, not actual memories)
- Could be cleaned up in future

### Next Session Priorities

1. **Update Production to v1.9.4**
   ```bash
   npm update @dollhousemcp/mcp-server
   # or
   npm install @dollhousemcp/mcp-server@1.9.4
   ```

2. **Test Memory Features in Production**
   - List memories and verify names display
   - Create new memories
   - Test activation/deactivation
   - Verify retention policies
   - Test memory persistence

3. **Clean Up Legacy Files** (Optional)
   - Move or remove `.md` template files
   - Keep only actual `.yaml` memory files

## Version Summary

### v1.9.3 (Released Sept 19, 2025)
- **Fixed**: Memory Element MCP Support
- **Impact**: Memories now recognized by all tools
- **PR**: #1028

### v1.9.4 (Released Sept 19, 2025)
- **Fixed**: Memory names showing as "Unnamed Memory"
- **Impact**: Names display correctly
- **PR**: #1030, #1031

## Repository Status

- **Current Branch**: develop (v1.9.4)
- **Main Branch**: v1.9.4 (latest release)
- **npm Latest**: v1.9.4
- **All CI Checks**: ✅ Passing

## Key Learnings

1. **Always Check Property Paths**: The bug was simply using wrong property (`metadata` vs `data`)
2. **File Format Consistency**: Memories should only be `.yaml`, not `.md`
3. **Regression Tests Important**: Added test to prevent this specific bug from recurring
4. **GitHub Workflows Work Well**: Auto-publishing to npm and creating releases saves time

## Files Modified

### v1.9.3 Changes
- `src/index.ts` - Added memory cases to 8 methods
- `test/__tests__/unit/server/tools/GenericElementTools.integration.test.ts` - Updated test
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added v1.9.3 notes
- `package.json` - Version bump to 1.9.3

### v1.9.4 Changes
- `src/elements/memories/MemoryManager.ts` - Fixed metadata parsing
- `test/__tests__/unit/elements/memories/MemoryManager.test.ts` - Added regression test
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added v1.9.4 notes
- `package.json` - Version bump to 1.9.4
