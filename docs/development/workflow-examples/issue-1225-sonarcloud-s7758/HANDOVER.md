- ✅ **Issue #1224 / PR #1227**: Fixed 4 MEDIUM severity issues (merged October 1)

### SonarCloud Progress
- **Total issues resolved**: 243+ issues (from 262 down to ~19 remaining)
- **Security hotspots**: All 199 evaluated and marked SAFE
- **Current status**: LOW priority cleanup remaining

## Your Mission: Issue #1225

### Issue Details
- **Title**: [SonarCloud] Fix S7758 - String method modernization (6 issues)
- **Rule**: typescript:S7758
- **Count**: 6 issues
- **Severity**: LOW reliability impact
- **Type**: CODE_SMELL
- **Estimated Time**: 30 minutes (with 50% buffer = 45 minutes)

### What S7758 Covers
String method modernization, likely including:
- `String.fromCharCode()` → `String.fromCodePoint()` (Unicode-aware)
- `str.charCodeAt()` → `str.codePointAt()` (Unicode-aware)
- Other modern string method improvements

### Why This Matters
- **Final cleanup**: This achieves ZERO reliability issues! 🎉
- **Unicode correctness**: Modern methods handle Unicode properly
- **Code quality**: Follows modern JavaScript/TypeScript best practices

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Query SonarCloud for S7758 Issues

**CRITICAL**: Use the correct query procedure from `docs/development/SONARCLOUD_QUERY_PROCEDURE.md`

```bash
# Get SonarCloud token
SONAR_TOKEN=$(security find-generic-password -s "sonar_token2" -w)

# Query for S7758 issues on main branch
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $SONAR_TOKEN" \
  "https://sonarcloud.io/api/issues/search?projects=DollhouseMCP_mcp-server&branch=main&rules=typescript:S7758&ps=500" \
  > /tmp/s7758-issues.json

# View issue count and locations
jq '.total, (.issues | length)' /tmp/s7758-issues.json
jq -r '.issues[] | "\(.component | sub(".*:"; "")):\(.line) - \(.message)"' /tmp/s7758-issues.json
```

### Step 2: Create Feature Branch

```bash
# Ensure on develop
git checkout develop && git pull

# Create feature branch following naming convention
git checkout -b feature/sonarcloud-issue-1225-string-methods

# Verify branch
git branch --show-current
```

### Step 3: Analyze and Fix Each Instance

For each issue location:

1. **Read the file** at the specific line number
2. **Understand the context** - what is the code doing?
3. **Evaluate the fix**:
   - Is it safe to change `fromCharCode` to `fromCodePoint`?
   - Is it safe to change `charCodeAt` to `codePointAt`?
   - Will this affect Unicode handling?
4. **Apply the fix** using Edit tool
5. **Document why** in code comments if needed

**Example Pattern**:
```typescript
// Before (S7758 violation)
const char = String.fromCharCode(0x1F600);

// After (S7758 compliant)
const char = String.fromCodePoint(0x1F600);
```

### Step 4: Verify Changes

```bash
# Build must succeed
npm run build

# Tests must pass
npm test -- --no-coverage

# Check for unintended changes
git diff

# Expected: 6 files changed, clean test results
```

### Step 5: Commit and Push

```bash
# Stage changes
git add <changed-files>

# Commit with proper message format
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
fix(sonarcloud): [S7758] String method modernization (6 issues)

- Replaced String.fromCharCode with String.fromCodePoint (X instances)
- Replaced str.charCodeAt with str.codePointAt (Y instances)
- Files affected: [list main files]
- SonarCloud impact: -6 reliability issues (ZERO remaining!)

Resolves #1225

### Step 6: Create Pull Request

```bash
gh pr create --base develop --title "fix(sonarcloud): Fix S7758 - String method modernization (6 issues)" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
Resolves #1225

Modernizes string methods to follow SonarCloud rule S7758.

## Changes
- Replaced `String.fromCharCode()` with `String.fromCodePoint()` for Unicode correctness
- Replaced `str.charCodeAt()` with `str.codePointAt()` where appropriate
- 6 instances fixed across [X] files

## Files Modified
[List files here after analysis]

## Testing
- ✅ Build passes
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Unicode handling verified

## Impact
- **SonarCloud**: -6 reliability issues resolved
- **Achievement**: ZERO reliability issues remaining! 🎉
- **Severity**: Low
- **Risk**: Low (Unicode-aware methods are safer)

### Step 7: Wait for CI and Merge

```bash
# Check CI status
gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER>

# Once all green, merge (user will approve)
# User will run: gh pr merge <PR_NUMBER> --squash --delete-branch

# Close issue
# User will run: gh issue close 1225 --comment "Completed via PR #<NUMBER>"
```

## Critical References

### Documentation to Read First
1. `docs/development/SONARCLOUD_QUERY_PROCEDURE.md` - **MUST READ**
2. `docs/development/PR_BEST_PRACTICES.md` - PR format
3. `docs/development/GITFLOW_GUARDIAN.md` - Branch workflow

### Memory References
- `sonarcloud-api-reference` - API usage patterns
- `sonarcloud-rules-reference` - Rule lookups (if exists)
- Session memories from October 1, 2025 - workflow examples

### Recent PR Examples
- **PR #1232**: Clean simple changes, good commit message
- **PR #1233**: 15 instances fixed, good file listing

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T
1. **Skip querying SonarCloud** - You need exact line numbers
2. **Change Array.isArray or String.isString** - Only change the specific methods flagged
3. **Fix issues on wrong branch** - Must be on feature branch from develop
4. **Batch commit multiple rule types** - Each issue gets its own PR
5. **Forget to test** - npm test MUST pass

### ✅ DO
1. **Query by file** - Use `--components` flag when verifying fixes
2. **Read surrounding context** - Understand why the code exists
3. **Test Unicode cases** - Make sure emoji/special chars work
4. **Document in PR** - List all files and instance counts
5. **Follow naming conventions** - `feature/sonarcloud-issue-1225-string-methods`

## Edge Cases to Consider

### Unicode Handling
- `fromCodePoint` can handle code points > 0xFFFF (emoji, etc.)
- `fromCharCode` only handles 16-bit values
- Check if code is dealing with emoji, special Unicode, or just ASCII

### Backward Compatibility
- `fromCodePoint` and `codePointAt` are ES6 (Node 14+)
- Our target is Node 20+, so this is safe

### False Positives
If SonarCloud flagged something incorrectly:
```bash
# Mark as false positive with curl (MCP tools are broken)
curl -X POST "https://sonarcloud.io/api/issues/do_transition" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SONAR_TOKEN" \
  -d "issue=<issue_key>" \
  -d "transition=falsepositive"

# Add comment explaining why
curl -X POST "https://sonarcloud.io/api/issues/add_comment" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SONAR_TOKEN" \
  -d "issue=<issue_key>" \
  -d "text=Explanation of why this is not an issue"
```

## Expected Outcome

### Success Metrics
- ✅ 6 issues fixed
- ✅ Build passes
- ✅ Tests pass (2323+ tests)
- ✅ PR created and CI green
- ✅ **SonarCloud shows ZERO reliability issues**

### Files to Track
Create a todo list after querying to track:
```
- [ ] Query SonarCloud for S7758 locations
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Fix issue 1/6 at [file:line]
- [ ] Fix issue 2/6 at [file:line]
- [ ] Fix issue 3/6 at [file:line]
- [ ] Fix issue 4/6 at [file:line]
- [ ] Fix issue 5/6 at [file:line]
- [ ] Fix issue 6/6 at [file:line]
- [ ] Run build verification
- [ ] Run test verification
- [ ] Commit and push
- [ ] Create PR
- [ ] Wait for CI
```

## Questions to Ask User

Before starting, confirm:
1. Should I proceed with all 6 fixes, or review each one first?
2. Any specific files I should be careful with?
3. Do you want to review the query results before I start fixing?

## Time Estimate

- Query SonarCloud: 2 minutes
- Analyze 6 instances: 10 minutes
- Apply fixes: 10 minutes
- Testing: 5 minutes
- Commit/PR: 5 minutes
- **Total**: ~32 minutes
- **With buffer**: ~45 minutes

## Contact/Escalation

If you encounter:
- **Broken MCP tools**: Use curl workarounds (documented in sonarcloud-api-reference)
- **Test failures**: Check if they're pre-existing (GitHubRateLimiter issue #1165)
- **Unclear fixes**: Ask user for guidance on specific instance
- **CI failures**: Check which step failed, may need iteration

## Final Checklist

Before declaring complete:
- [ ] All 6 S7758 instances addressed

- [ ] Tests pass locally (npm test)
- [ ] PR created with proper format
