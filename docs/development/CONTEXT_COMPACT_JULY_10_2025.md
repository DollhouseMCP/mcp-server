# Context Compact - July 10, 2025

## Current State
- **Version**: v1.2.2 published to NPM as `@mickdarling/dollhousemcp`
- **Security**: 100% complete (SEC-001, SEC-003, SEC-004, SEC-005)
- **Tests**: 487 all passing
- **CI**: All workflows green
- **NPM Org**: "DollhouseMCP" created, ready for migration

## Today's Accomplishments
1. Fixed flaky timing test (PR #185) - Skip in CI, maintain security
2. Published v1.2.2 to NPM
3. Created comprehensive GitHub release
4. Updated CHANGELOG and README with security features
5. Created NPM organization for future migration

## Next Session Priority
**NPM Organization Migration** to `@dollhousemcp/mcp-server`
- See: `/docs/development/NPM_ORGANIZATION_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
- Quick start: `QUICK_START_NEXT_SESSION.md`

## Key Technical Context
- Package will change from `@mickdarling/dollhousemcp` to `@dollhousemcp/mcp-server`
- Installation path: `node_modules/@dollhousemcp/mcp-server/`
- Only ~40 downloads, so low impact migration
- Deprecate old package with redirect message

## What Mick Wants
1. NPM org migration (immediate)
2. User features: export/import/sharing (after migration)
3. No more infrastructure work for now

## Important Files Modified Today
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added v1.2.2 release notes
- `README.md` - Added security section, updated version
- `package.json` - Version bumped to 1.2.2

## Commands for Next Time
```bash
cd /Users/mick/Developer/MCP-Servers/DollhouseMCP
git pull
# Then follow NPM_ORGANIZATION_MIGRATION_PLAN.md
```

## Remember
- Security is DONE âœ…
- Focus on USER FEATURES after NPM migration
- All reference docs are in `/docs/development/`
- Mick got sleepy at 5 PM Thursday ðŸ˜´

Good session! v1.2.2 is live with comprehensive security! ðŸš€
