# Session Notes - August 5, 2025 - Collection Browsing Fix (v1.5.1)

## Session Overview
**Time**: Afternoon session
**Branch**: fix/collection-browsing-v151
**Context**: Fixed critical collection browsing failures in v1.5.0
**PR**: #472 (pending review)
**Issue**: #471 (created to track bugs)

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Identified Collection Browsing Issues
User reported that collection browsing was failing in v1.5.0, even though the collection repository is public. Through investigation, we found two critical bugs:

#### Bug 1: OAuth Token Not Being Retrieved
- **Location**: `src/collection/GitHubClient.ts` line 59
- **Problem**: Code was using `TokenManager.getGitHubToken()` which only checks environment variables
- **Impact**: OAuth tokens from v1.5.0's new `setup_github_auth` were stored in secure storage but never used
- **Fix**: Changed to `await TokenManager.getGitHubTokenAsync()` which checks both env vars and secure storage

#### Bug 2: Legacy Category Validation
- **Location**: `src/index.ts` lines 1779-1780  
- **Problem**: `browseCollection()` was using `validateCategory()` which validates against old categories: `['creative', 'professional', 'educational', 'gaming', 'personal']`
- **Impact**: Valid values like "library" and "personas" were rejected before reaching the API
- **Fix**: Replaced with proper validation for sections (library, showcase, catalog) and types (personas, skills, etc.)

### 2. Created GitHub Issue #471
Documented both bugs with detailed explanation, root causes, and proposed fixes.

### 3. Implemented Fixes Following GitFlow
- Synced main and develop branches
- Created feature branch: `fix/collection-browsing-v151`
- Fixed both issues with inline documentation
- Updated version to 1.5.1
- Updated CHANGELOG.md

### 4. Testing
- Build successful
- All 528 tests passing
- No TypeScript errors

### 5. Created PR #472
Submitted comprehensive PR from feature branch to develop with detailed explanation of changes.

## Current State

### What's Pending
1. **PR Review**: Waiting for PR #472 to be reviewed and approved
2. **Merge to develop**: Once approved, merge the fix
3. **Release process**: Follow GitFlow to release v1.5.1

### Claude Desktop Configuration
During the session, we also updated the Claude Desktop configuration to use the NPM version of DollhouseMCP:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dollhousemcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@dollhousemcp/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Session Tasks

### 1. Check PR Status
```bash
cd /Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server
gh pr view 472
gh pr checks 472
```

### 2. If PR Approved
```bash
# Merge PR
gh pr merge 472 --squash

# Switch to develop
git checkout develop
git pull

# Create release branch for v1.5.1
git checkout -b release/1.5.1
```

### 3. Release v1.5.1
Follow the GitFlow release process:
1. Ensure version is 1.5.1 in package.json
2. Ensure CHANGELOG.md is updated
3. Create PR from release/1.5.1 to main
4. After merge, tag v1.5.1
5. Publish to NPM

### 4. Verify Fixes Work
After release, test that:
1. Collection browsing works without authentication
2. OAuth tokens from `setup_github_auth` are properly used
3. Valid sections/types are accepted

### 5. Additional Issues to Address
We also discovered:
- Git version detection issue (detecting old system Git instead of Homebrew Git)
- This is lower priority but should be investigated

## Key Files Changed

1. **src/collection/GitHubClient.ts**
   - Line 60: Changed to async token retrieval
   - Line 82: Updated error message to mention OAuth

2. **src/index.ts**
   - Lines 1778-1797: Complete replacement of category validation
   - Now validates sections and types separately with proper error messages

3. **CHANGELOG.md**
   - Added v1.5.1 section with fix details

4. **package.json**
   - Version bumped to 1.5.1

## Commands for Quick Reference

```bash
# Check PR status
gh pr view 472

# View your branch
git branch --show-current

# Run tests
npm test -- --no-coverage

# Build
npm run build

# Check for type errors
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Important Context for Next Session

1. **The bugs were critical** - Collection browsing is a core feature and was completely broken
2. **Both fixes are small but important** - Just a few lines changed but major impact
3. **GitFlow workflow** - We're following proper process with feature → develop → release → main
4. **NPM release** - After v1.5.1 is on main, it needs to be published to NPM

## Session Summary

We successfully diagnosed and fixed two critical bugs that were preventing collection browsing from working in v1.5.0. The fixes are simple but crucial:
- OAuth tokens are now properly retrieved from secure storage
- Legacy validation code has been replaced with correct validation

PR #472 is ready for review. Once approved and released as v1.5.1, collection browsing should work properly again.
