# Session Notes - August 26, 2025 - Release 1.6.8 In Progress

**Time**: Evening session  
**Branch**: `release/1.6.8`  
**Context**: Creating v1.6.9 release following GitFlow exactly, stopping before tagging

## Current Status: Release PR Created, Waiting for CI

### Where We Are
1. ✅ Created `release/1.6.8` branch from develop
2. ✅ Ran version bump script - updated to 1.6.8
3. ✅ Committed version changes
4. ✅ Created PR #783 from `release/1.6.8` to `main`
5. ✅ Updated branch by merging main into release branch
6. 🔄 **CURRENTLY**: Waiting for CI checks to pass on PR #783
7. ⏳ After CI passes: Merge PR to main
8. ⏳ **IMPORTANT**: STOP before tagging for visual confirmation (user request)

### What This Release Contains

**v1.6.9 - Bug Fix Release**
- **Main Fix**: OAuth client ID configuration display issue (PR #782)
  - The `configure_oauth` tool was incorrectly showing "Not Configured" when using the default OAuth client ID
  - Fixed to properly show "Using Default" vs "Configured" status
  - Eliminates user confusion about OAuth being "not configured" when it actually works

### The Issue We Fixed
**Problem**: Two different code paths for OAuth:
1. `configure_oauth` tool only checked ConfigManager (env var or config file)
2. `GitHubAuthManager` had a DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID fallback

**Solution**: Updated `configure_oauth` to use `GitHubAuthManager.getClientId()` to match actual auth logic

### Current PR Status
- **PR #783**: https://github.com/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server/pull/783
- **Title**: Release v1.6.9
- **Base**: main
- **Head**: release/1.6.8
- **CI Status**: Running (as of session end)

## Next Steps for Next Session

### 1. Check CI Status
```bash
gh pr checks 783
```

### 2. Once All Checks Pass, Merge PR
```bash
gh pr merge 783 --merge
```

### 3. Switch to Main and Pull
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### 4. ⚠️ STOP HERE FOR VISUAL CONFIRMATION ⚠️
**DO NOT TAG YET** - User wants to visually confirm everything is correct before creating the tag

### 5. After User Confirmation, Create Tag
```bash
# Only after user says "okay to tag"
git tag v1.6.9
git push origin v1.6.9
```

### 6. Complete GitFlow - Merge Back to Develop
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge main
git push origin develop
```

### 7. Clean Up Release Branch
```bash
git branch -d release/1.6.8
git push origin --delete release/1.6.8
```

## Important Context

### Version Script Works Now
The version bump script (`scripts/update-version.mjs`) is now working correctly after fixes in v1.6.7:
- No longer creates wrong files
- Doesn't corrupt package-lock.json
- Properly updates only the files that need updating

### GitFlow Process Being Followed
We're following GitFlow exactly:
1. Feature branches → develop
2. Release branches from develop → main
3. Tag on main
4. Merge main back to develop
5. Hotfixes from main → main and develop

### Files Changed in This Release
- `package.json` - version 1.6.8
- `package-lock.json` - version 1.6.8
- `README.md` - version references updated
- `CHANGELOG.md` - added 1.6.8 entry
- `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` - version updated
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - version updated
- `docs/RELEASE_WORKFLOW.md` - version in examples
- `docs/development/SESSION_NOTES_2025_08_26_VERSION_RELEASE_1.6.7.md` - updated references

## Commands to Start Next Session

```bash
# Get on the release branch
cd /Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server
git checkout release/1.6.8
git pull

# Check PR status
gh pr view 783
gh pr checks 783

# If CI is green and ready to merge:
gh pr merge 783 --merge

# Then switch to main
git checkout main
git pull

# STOP HERE - wait for user confirmation before tagging!
```

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Version 1.6.9** - Patch release for the OAuth display bug fix
2. **Following GitFlow** - Creating proper release branch, PR to main, will tag after merge
3. **Stopping before tag** - User explicitly requested visual confirmation before tagging

## Session Statistics
- **PRs Created**: 1 (#783 - Release v1.6.9)
- **Branches Created**: 1 (release/1.6.8)
- **Version Bumped**: From 1.6.7 to 1.6.8
- **Files Updated**: 8 files with version changes

## Critical Reminder
⚠️ **DO NOT CREATE THE TAG WITHOUT USER CONFIRMATION** ⚠️

The user specifically requested:
> "I want you to stop before you tag the new version because we need to visually confirm all the things are correct before we tag the new version."
