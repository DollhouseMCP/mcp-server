# Session Notes - September 19, 2025 Afternoon - Post-Release Cleanup

## Session Overview
Post-v1.9.0 release cleanup session focused on documentation fixes, root directory organization, and README improvements.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. v1.9.0 Release ✅
- Successfully merged PR #1002 (Memory element implementation)
- Created and pushed v1.9.0 tag
- Published to NPM (@dollhousemcp/mcp-server@1.9.0)
- Created GitHub release with comprehensive notes
- Release URL: https://github.com/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server/releases/tag/v1.9.0

### 2. Issue #1004 Created ✅
- Documented all cleanup needs identified during release review
- Comprehensive list of README issues, root cleanup, and CI problems
- URL: https://github.com/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server/issues/1004

### 3. PR #1005 - Initial Cleanup ✅
- Merged to develop branch
- Moved release notes to docs/releases/
- Moved test scripts to test/scripts/
- Updated README chunks for Memory availability
- Fixed Available Now vs Coming Soon sections
- Added Memory folder structure documentation
- Created RELEASE_PROCESS.md documentation

### 4. PR #1006 - Additional Cleanup (In Progress)
- Created fix/additional-root-cleanup branch
- Moved Docker test files to docker/test-configs/
- Moved security suppressions to src/security/audit/config/
- Updated SecurityAuditor.ts for new path
- Added Memory to hero section chunk
- **Status**: Ready for review, no conflicts

## Key Discoveries

### NPM Release Workflow Failure
- **Root Cause**: Package.json version mismatch with git tag
- **Problem**: We updated package.json locally but didn't commit before tagging
- **Solution**: Documented proper release process in RELEASE_PROCESS.md
- **Future**: Always commit version bump before creating release tag

### README Build System
- READMEs are built from chunks in docs/readme/chunks/
- Should NOT commit built README files in PRs
- Only edit chunks, let build system handle README generation
- This prevents merge conflicts

### Security Suppressions File
- `.security-suppressions.json` shouldn't be in root
- Moved to src/security/audit/config/ for better organization
- Updated code to use new path

## Outstanding Work for Next Session

### README Improvements Still Needed
1. Memory appears incomplete in some sections after build
2. Need to verify all chunks properly include Memory
3. May need to update additional chunks we haven't found yet

### Hotfix Strategy
Once PR #1006 is merged to develop:
1. Create hotfix branch from main
2. Cherry-pick documentation fixes
3. Push to main (no version bump needed)
4. Sync main back to develop

## File Organization Summary

### Root Directory (Cleaned)
**Kept**:
- Essential configs (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- README files (built from chunks)
- LICENSE, CHANGELOG, CONTRIBUTING
- claude.md (Claude project context)
- oauth-helper.mjs (needed functionality)

**Moved**:
- Docker test files → docker/test-configs/
- Security reports → docs/security/
- Security suppressions → src/security/audit/config/
- Test scripts → test/scripts/
- Release notes → docs/releases/

## Lessons Learned

1. **GitFlow Discipline**: Always merge main back to develop after releases
2. **Release Process**: Package.json version must be committed before tagging
3. **README Management**: Only edit chunks, never commit built READMEs in feature branches
4. **Security Config**: Keep security configuration files out of root visibility
5. **Memory Documentation**: Needs to be added in multiple places in chunks

## Next Session Priority

1. Review and merge PR #1006
2. Verify README builds correctly with all Memory references
3. Create hotfix to update main's documentation
4. Close issue #1004

## Metrics

- **PRs Created**: 3 (#1002, #1005, #1006)
- **PRs Merged**: 2 (#1002, #1005)
- **Issues Created**: 1 (#1004)
- **Files Moved**: 27+
- **Release Version**: v1.9.0 successfully published

## Time Investment
- Release process: ~10 minutes
- Cleanup and documentation: ~45 minutes
- Total session: ~55 minutes
