# Session Notes - September 20, 2025 - CLAUDE.md Cleanup and Verification

## Session Overview
**Date**: September 20, 2025
**Time**: ~9:00 AM - 9:30 AM EDT
**Focus**: System maintenance, CLAUDE.md cleanup across all repositories
**Starting Context**: User had input lag concerns, checked system resources, then moved to documentation cleanup

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. System Resource Analysis ✅
- **Docker Cleanup**: Stopped 6 idle containers consuming CPU
  - 4 MCP test environments (leftover from Sept 15)
  - 1 blog development server (mickblog_dev)
  - 1 Open WebUI for local LLMs
- **Result**: CPU usage dropped from 59.4% to 0.0% for virtualization
- **Memory**: 46 GB free out of 128 GB total (healthy)
- **DollhouseMCP**: Only 1 clean instance running, minimal resources

### 2. CLAUDE.md Files Comprehensive Cleanup ✅
Successfully updated all 7 CLAUDE.md files across the organization:

#### Main Organization File
- **Location**: `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/CLAUDE.md`
- **Changes**: Complete rewrite with accurate repo structure, current guidelines
- **Key Addition**: Dual session management (notes + memory system)

#### Repository-Specific Files (6)
1. **mcp-server**: Removed July 2025 content, focused on current development
2. **collection**: Removed old milestones, focused on validation system
3. **collection-temp**: Created simple temporary workspace documentation
4. **experimental-collection**: Added strong PRIVATE warnings
5. **experimental-server**: Added patent protection warnings
6. **AILIS**: Minor date update (was already good)

### 3. Documentation Standards Established ✅
- **Directory Context**: Each file starts with "YOU ARE IN: [path]"
- **Public vs Private**: Clear warnings for private repos
- **No Dated Content**: Removed all session-specific dates
- **Consistent Format**: Unified structure across all files

## Important Discoveries

### Repository Structure Verification
- **13 Active Repositories** confirmed
- **6 Public**: mcp-server, collection, developer-kit, AILIS, website, github-profile
- **7 Private**: All experimental repos, business, catalog, tools-internal, collection-temp

### Memory System Issue Identified
- **Problem**: MCP tools show "No content stored" even when YAML files have content
- **Location**: `~/.dollhouse/portfolio/memories/`
- **Files Exist**: Session memories from Sept 19 found and readable
- **Display Bug**: Content exists but tools can't display it

### Critical Clarifications from User
1. **All 3 experimental repos**: DO NOT EXPOSE (patent-pending)
2. **Website**: Now PUBLIC (confirmed via gh repo view)
3. **AILIS**: AI Layer Interface Specification (not AI assistant)
4. **Ensembles**: Multiple personas layer together by default
5. **Security Policy**: Fix issues immediately, no deferring

## Session Management Strategy

### Belt & Suspenders Approach
Per user directive, using BOTH methods:
1. **Traditional session notes** (this file) - Source of truth
2. **Memory system** - Mirror/backup of session notes
3. **Process**: Write notes first, then commit to memory

## Technical Issues Noted

### GitFlow Guardian False Positive
- **Issue**: Warns incorrectly when creating feature branch from develop
- **Status**: Known bug, documented in CLAUDE.md files
- **Workaround**: Verify branch creation was correct and proceed

### Memory System Display Bug
- **Issue**: YAML content not showing in MCP tools
- **Files**: Exist and are readable directly
- **Impact**: Can't rely on memory display, must read files directly

## Files Modified

### CLAUDE.md Files (7)
- `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/CLAUDE.md`
- `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server/CLAUDE.md`
- `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/collection/CLAUDE.md`
- `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/collection-temp/CLAUDE.md`
- `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/experimental-collection/CLAUDE.md`
- `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/experimental-server/CLAUDE.md`
- `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/AILIS/CLAUDE.md`

### Session Notes Created
- This file: `SESSION_NOTES_2025_09_20_CLAUDE_MD_CLEANUP.md`

## Key Insights

1. **Documentation Accuracy Critical**: User emphasized CLAUDE.md is "considered truth"
2. **No Assumptions**: Must read and verify, not rely on old context
3. **Security First**: Issues must be fixed immediately in solo project
4. **Private Repo Protection**: Experimental repos need strongest warnings

## Next Session Recommendations

1. **Fix Memory Display Bug**: Investigate why MCP tools can't read YAML content
2. **GitFlow Guardian**: Consider fixing the false positive bug
3. **Regular Maintenance**: Periodically verify CLAUDE.md accuracy
4. **Memory System**: Continue dual approach until display bug fixed

## Session Statistics

- **Duration**: ~30 minutes
- **Files Updated**: 7 CLAUDE.md files + 1 session note
- **Docker Containers Stopped**: 6
- **System Performance**: Improved (CPU usage reduced significantly)
- **Documentation**: All repos now have current, accurate CLAUDE.md files

## User Feedback

User was appreciative of the cleanup work. Emphasized importance of:
- Reading actual files instead of making assumptions
- Maintaining accurate documentation
- Fixing issues immediately rather than deferring
- Using both session notes and memory system for reliability
