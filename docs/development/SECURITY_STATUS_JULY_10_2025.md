## Completed Security Components

### 1. ContentValidator (`src/security/contentValidator.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Detect and block prompt injection attempts
- **Features**:
  - 20+ injection pattern detection
  - Severity classification (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
  - Content sanitization with [CONTENT_BLOCKED]
  - YAML validation integration
- **PR #156**: Merged July 9, 2025

### 2. SecurityMonitor (`src/security/securityMonitor.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized security event logging and alerting
- **Features**:
  - Real-time event logging
  - Critical event alerts
  - Security report generation
  - Event buffer (last 1000 events)
- **Integration**: Used by all security components

### 3. SecureYamlParser (`src/security/secureYamlParser.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Safe YAML parsing preventing deserialization attacks
- **Features**:
  - FAILSAFE_SCHEMA only (no type coercion)
  - Pattern detection for malicious YAML
  - Field validation and size limits
  - gray-matter compatible API
- **PR #171**: Merged July 9, 2025

### 4. SecureTokenManager (`src/security/tokenManager.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Secure GitHub token handling
- **Features**:
  - Token format validation (ghp_*, gho_*, github_pat_*)
  - Permission verification via API
  - Error sanitization (tokens â†’ [REDACTED])
  - Secure caching with 1-hour TTL
  - Rate limit monitoring
- **PR #173**: Merged July 10, 2025

### 5. SecurityError (`src/errors/SecurityError.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Specialized security exceptions
- **Features**:
  - Severity levels
  - Error codes
  - Contextual details
  - Factory methods

## Security Event Types

```typescript
type SecurityEventType = 
  | 'CONTENT_INJECTION_ATTEMPT'
  | 'YAML_INJECTION_ATTEMPT' 
  | 'PATH_TRAVERSAL_ATTEMPT'
  | 'TOKEN_VALIDATION_FAILURE'
  | 'TOKEN_VALIDATION_SUCCESS'
  | 'UPDATE_SECURITY_VIOLATION'
  | 'RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED'
  | 'RATE_LIMIT_WARNING'
  | 'YAML_PARSING_WARNING'
  | 'YAML_PARSE_SUCCESS'
  | 'TOKEN_CACHE_CLEARED';
```

## Enhancement Issues Created

Based on Claude's security reviews, the following enhancement issues have been created:

### From SEC-001 Review
- #162-170: Various improvements (unicode normalization, ReDoS protection, etc.)

### From SEC-003 Review  
- #172: Optimize regex compilation

### From SEC-004 Review
- #174: Rate limiting for token validation (High)
- #175: Async cache refresh (High)
- #176-180: Various improvements (Medium/Low)

## Test Coverage
- **Total Tests**: 487 (all passing)
- **Security-Specific Tests**: 115+
  - ContentValidator: 32 tests
  - SecureYamlParser: 27 tests
  - SecureTokenManager: 21 tests
  - Docker Security: 29 tests
  - Integration tests: 6+

## SEC-005 Docker Security (PR #181 - In Review)

### Implementation Highlights
1. **Dockerfile Hardening**:
   - Removed curl, wget, git from production
   - Non-root user with restricted shell
   - Strict permissions (750 app, 700 writable)
   - Security labels for scanning

2. **Docker Compose Security**:
   - Explicit user: "1001:1001"
   - Drop ALL capabilities
   - Read-only root filesystem
   - Tmpfs mounts with noexec,nosuid
   - Private IPC namespace

3. **Testing**:
   - 29 comprehensive security tests
   - Validates both files and runtime behavior

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth Layers
1. **Input Validation**: Path, filename, and content validation
2. **Content Analysis**: Pattern detection for injection attempts
3. **Safe Processing**: FAILSAFE YAML, sanitized errors
4. **Access Control**: Token validation, permission checks
5. **Container Security**: Non-root, read-only, no capabilities
6. **Monitoring**: Event logging, alerts, metrics

### Key Security Features
- No tokens exposed in logs or errors
- All YAML safely parsed (no code execution)
- Injection attempts blocked and logged
- Container hardened against escape
- Comprehensive audit trail

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Merge PR #181 (SEC-005) once reviewed
2. NPM publish v1.2.2 with all security fixes
3. Update README with security features

### High Priority Enhancements
1. Issue #174: Rate limiting for token validation
2. Issue #175: Async cache refresh for tokens
3. Issue #162: Unicode normalization for patterns

### Medium Priority
1. Security dashboard for monitoring
2. Automated security testing in CI
3. Regular pattern updates

## Success Metrics
- 4/5 vulnerabilities fixed and merged (80%)
- 1/5 awaiting review (20%)
- 0 security alerts in production
- 115+ security tests passing
- All Claude reviews positive (A-, Strong, 9/10)

## Summary
DollhouseMCP has undergone a comprehensive security transformation, implementing enterprise-grade security features across all layers. Once SEC-005 is merged, all identified vulnerabilities will be addressed, making the platform ready for production use with confidence.
