# Session Notes - Marketplace Preparation - October 14, 2025

**Date**: October 14, 2025
**Time**: 10:15 AM - 11:45 AM (~90 minutes)
**Focus**: Prepare DollhouseMCP for MCP Registry and marketplace visibility
**Outcome**: ✅ Professional infrastructure established, messaging refined

## Session Summary

Completed critical infrastructure setup to prepare DollhouseMCP for publication to the MCP Registry (VS Code marketplace). Established professional email addresses, refined organizational messaging away from "persona management" to "customization elements," and began dual licensing implementation.

## Context: Discovery & Planning

### Initial Goal
Publish DollhouseMCP to the new MCP Registry (launched ~Oct 10, 2025 in VS Code 1.105) which shows MCP servers in VS Code's Extensions view alongside GitHub Copilot integration.

### Research Findings
- **MCP Registry**: GitHub-hosted registry at modelcontextprotocol.io
- **Publisher CLI**: `mcp-publisher` tool for submissions
- **Authentication**: GitHub OAuth for `io.github.*` namespaces
- **Requirements**: NPM package (✅ already published), server.json file, namespace validation
- **No conflicts**: STDIO servers with local file access are standard pattern

### Dependency Chain Identified
1. Email infrastructure (professional contact addresses)
2. GitHub organization profile (visitor guidance)
3. Repository references update (personal → org)
4. Commercial license finalization
5. MCP Registry submission

## Work Completed

### 1. Email Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETE

**Service**: Google Workspace Business Starter ($6/month)
- Selected over Cloudflare Email Routing (can't send easily)
- Selected over Zoho ($1/month) for professional polish

**Setup Process**:
- Added dollhousemcp.com as "User alias domain" (not secondary domain)
- Configured MX records via Cloudflare DNS (already existed from previous attempt)
- Created professional email addresses:
  - **mick@dollhousemcp.com** - Primary contact
  - **support@dollhousemcp.com** - Technical support
  - **contact@dollhousemcp.com** - General inquiries

**Configuration Notes**:
- User alias domains create matching addresses automatically
- Had to convert to secondary domain to create custom aliases (support@, contact@)
- All aliases deliver to single inbox
- Can send FROM any configured address via Gmail "Send mail as"

**Testing**: ✅ Verified send/receive working for all addresses

### 2. GitHub Organization Profile ✅ COMPLETE

**Repository**: `.github` (github-profile local directory)
**Branch**: `feature/update-org-profile-professional-contact`
**File**: `profile/README.md`

**Major Messaging Changes**:

**OLD** (July 29, 2025):
- "Professional AI Persona Management Platform"
- Focus on personas as primary element
- Generic developer language

**NEW** (October 14, 2025):
- "Build Your AI Tools with Natural Language"
- Focus on all customization elements: Personas, Skills, Templates, Agents, Memory
- Real-world examples with personality

**Key Updates**:
1. **Header Section**:
   - Emphasized "customization elements" over "persona management"
   - Added "Build once, use everywhere" as key value proposition
   - Listed all 5 element types explicitly

2. **Mission Statement**:
   - OLD: "To provide the most comprehensive, secure, and user-friendly AI persona management platform"
   - NEW: "Enable everyone to customize their AI experience using natural language"
   - Broader audience (everyone, not just developers)
   - Focus on customization, not just personas

3. **What is DollhouseMCP Section**:

   **For Everyone**:
   - Murder Mystery dinner party with AI that knows all the clues
   - Home organization with personas and memories
   - Writing voice training that learns YOUR style (not just "professional" or "casual")

   **For Developers**:
   - Security Analyst personas, Penetration Testing skills, Data Analysis
   - Real examples from actual collection
   - Cross-platform emphasis

   **For Businesses**:
   - Free up team for creative work requiring human talent and attention
   - Automate review against requirements
   - Organize information for better absorption

4. **Contact Information**:
   - Added professional email addresses first
   - Moved founder info to end
   - Updated website from "coming soon" to live

5. **Licensing**:
   - Added dual licensing information
   - AGPL-3.0 + Commercial License options
   - Contact info for commercial inquiries

6. **Footer**:
   - OLD: "Building the future of AI persona management, one personality at a time"
   - NEW: "Community driven, open source customization that enriches AI for everyone"

7. **Tool Count**:
   - Updated from "23+" to "47 tools" (current accurate count)
   - Decided NOT to emphasize tool count (high count = context bloat perception)

**Commit**: `67e38b8` - "Refine messaging to focus on customization elements vs persona management"

### 3. Commercial License Setup ✅ STARTED

**File Created**: `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` in mcp-server repository
**Branch**: `feature/add-commercial-license-option`

**Structure**:
- Dual licensing overview (AGPL-3.0 vs Commercial)
- Who needs commercial license (proprietary use, SaaS, etc.)
- AGPL-3.0 requirements explanation
- Commercial license benefits
- Pricing structure (case-by-case negotiation)
- Contact information: **mick@dollhousemcp.com**
- FAQ section
- License comparison table
- Legal notice

**Package.json Updated**:
- Changed author email from `mick@mickdarling.com` to `mick@dollhousemcp.com`
- Ready for NPM publication with professional contact

**README.md Update**: ⏳ PENDING
- Need to add dual licensing section to license chapter
- Format ready but not yet committed

## Messaging Workshop Process

Extensive collaborative refinement of organization messaging:

### Principles Established:
1. **No dashes** - Use commas, semicolons, periods instead
2. **Real examples** - Murder Mystery, D&D, Mr. Rogers, not generic use cases
3. **Avoid "professional/casual"** - Show specificity (YOUR voice, not generic categories)
4. **Cross-platform emphasis** - "Build once, use everywhere"
5. **Human-focused for business** - Free up time for creative work requiring talent and attention

### Key Phrases Developed:
- "Build once, use everywhere; your elements work across platforms"
- "Don't just let AI tell you what's professional or casual writing, show it examples of your work"
- "It can learn how to write in your voice and will remember your turns of phrase"
- "Free up your team for work that requires human creativity and judgment"

## Technical Decisions

### Email: Why Google Workspace?
- **Rejected Cloudflare Email Routing**: Can't send FROM @dollhousemcp.com easily
- **Rejected Zoho**: Less professional, unfamiliar interface
- **Selected Google Workspace**: Professional, familiar, works everywhere, $6/month acceptable

### Domain Configuration: Secondary vs Alias
- **User Alias Domain**: Automatically creates matching addresses (mick@)
- **Secondary Domain**: Allows custom aliases (support@, legal@, sales@)
- **Chose Secondary**: Needed flexibility for functional addresses

### Messaging: Why "Customization Elements"?
- More inclusive than "persona management"
- Reflects all 5 element types equally
- Broader use cases and audience
- Better SEO and discoverability

## Files Modified

### github-profile Repository
- `profile/README.md` - Complete messaging overhaul

### mcp-server Repository
- `COMMERCIAL_LICENSE.md` - Created
- `package.json` - Updated author email
- (README.md - pending)

## Known Issues & Decisions

### MCP Registry Publication
- **Status**: Ready for server.json creation
- **Namespace**: Will use `io.github.dollhousemcp/mcp-server`
- **No STDIO conflicts**: Local file access is standard for MCP servers

### Linting Issues
- Markdown linting warnings in org profile (minor, cosmetic)
- Can address in future cleanup

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate (Step 3 Completion):
1. Update README.md with dual licensing section
2. Commit commercial license changes
3. Push `feature/add-commercial-license-option` branch
4. Create PR for commercial license

### Step 4: Finalize Commercial License
1. Review commercial license for legal gaps
2. Consider consultation (not urgent, can iterate)
3. Add LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md reference to main LICENSE

### Step 5: MCP Registry Submission
1. Install mcp-publisher CLI: `brew install mcp-publisher`
2. Run `mcp-publisher init` in mcp-server directory
3. Configure server.json with:
   - Namespace: `io.github.dollhousemcp/mcp-server`
   - Package deployment method (NPM)
   - Already on NPM: `@dollhousemcp/mcp-server`
4. Authenticate: `mcp-publisher login github`
5. Publish: `mcp-publisher publish`
6. Verify: `curl "https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers?search=dollhouse"`

## Key Learnings

1. **Email setup complexity**: Google's onboarding is overwhelming, domain alias vs secondary domain distinction not obvious
2. **Messaging matters**: Spent significant time refining because first impression is critical for marketplace
3. **Tool count is liability**: High tool count suggests context bloat, don't emphasize
4. **Real examples resonate**: Murder Mystery and home organization much better than generic "customize AI"
5. **Professional infrastructure first**: Can't submit to marketplace with personal contact info
