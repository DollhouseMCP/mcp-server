# Memory Element Implementation Complete - July 21, 2025

## PR #334 Created Successfully
- Branch: `feature/memory-element-implementation`
- Status: All 62 tests passing
- Issue: #299

## Key Implementation Details
- Used DOMPurify for content sanitization (not aggressive sanitizeInput)
- FAILSAFE_SCHEMA for YAML import (not SecureYamlParser which expects frontmatter)
- Privacy levels work with <= logic (public < private < sensitive)
- Retention policy removes oldest when at capacity

## Critical Fixes Made
1. BaseElement.validate() returns `valid` not `isValid`
2. Memory content needs DOMPurify, not sanitizeInput (too aggressive)
3. MemoryManager import uses yaml.load with FAILSAFE_SCHEMA
4. Tag frequency Map converted to array for YAML serialization

## Security Event Types Added
- MEMORY_CREATED, MEMORY_ADDED, MEMORY_SEARCHED
- SENSITIVE_MEMORY_DELETED, RETENTION_POLICY_ENFORCED
- MEMORY_CLEARED, MEMORY_LOADED, MEMORY_SAVED
- MEMORY_DELETED, MEMORY_LOAD_FAILED, etc.

## Next: Agents Element
Most complex with goal management, Eisenhower matrix, state persistence
