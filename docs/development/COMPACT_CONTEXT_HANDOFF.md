# Compact Context Handoff - July 5, 2025

## Current State Summary
**Project**: DollhouseMCP - MCP server for AI persona management
**Test Status**: 100% passing (129 tests)
**CI/CD**: Fixed for all platforms (Windows/Mac/Linux)
**Major Gap**: Auto-update system has no tests

## What Just Happened
1. Fixed ESM test compatibility issues (was 74% â†’ now 100% pass rate)
2. Fixed Windows CI/CD failures (added cross-env)
3. Removed problematic tests that didn't match implementation
4. Created 3 new high-priority issues for follow-up

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Issue #61**: Write tests for auto-update system in `src/update/`
2. **Issue #62**: Document how auto-update system works
3. **Issue #40**: Prepare package for npm publishing

## Key Technical Context

### ESM Module Testing
- Jest with ESM has immutable binding issues
- Current workaround: manual mocks with `as any`
- Future solution: dependency injection or esmock library

### Auto-Update System
- **Exists**: Full implementation in `src/update/`
- **Works**: 4 MCP tools for updates
- **Problem**: Zero test coverage
- **Location**: UpdateManager, UpdateChecker, BackupManager, etc.

### Cross-Platform
- All test scripts now use `cross-env`
- Windows CI should work correctly
- NODE_OPTIONS handled properly

## File Locations
```
src/update/           # Auto-update implementation (needs tests)
__tests__/           # Test files (auto-update.test.ts removed)
docs/development/    # Documentation and context files
```

## Active Issues
- #61: Add integration tests for auto-update (HIGH)
- #62: Document auto-update architecture (HIGH)
- #63: Verify test coverage metrics (MEDIUM)
- #40: NPM publishing preparation (HIGH)
- #53: Security audit automation (HIGH)

## Key Decisions
- Only test our code, not Node.js
- Remove tests that don't match implementation
- Focus on business logic testing
- Use cross-env for all platforms

## Quick Commands
```bash
npm test              # Run all tests (100% pass)
npm run build         # Build TypeScript
gh issue list --state open --limit 10  # See priorities
```

## PR History Today
- PR #57: ESM compatibility (88% tests)
- PR #59: Complete ESM fix (100% tests)
- PR #60: CI/CD cross-platform fix

## What Needs Attention
1. Auto-update system completely untested
2. CI/CD badges should turn green soon
3. NPM publishing setup needed
4. Security audit automation needed
