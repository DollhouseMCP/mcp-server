## NEXT SESSION: Patch Release v1.9.19

### Proper GitFlow Release Process

#### Phase 1: Version Bump on Develop

**DO THIS FIRST** - All version bumps happen on develop before creating release branch.

```bash
# Ensure on develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Verify current version
grep '"version"' package.json  # Should show 1.9.18

# Update versions in 3 files
```

**Files to Update**:

1. **package.json** (line 3):
   ```json
   "version": "1.9.19",
   ```

2. **server.json** (line 6):
   ```json
   "version": "1.9.19",
   ```

   **AND** (line 17):
   ```json
   "version": "1.9.19",
   ```

3. **CHANGELOG.md** - Add new section at top:
   ```markdown
   ## [1.9.19] - 2025-10-17

   ### Added
   - MCP registry publishing workflow with OIDC authentication
   - Automated publishing to registry.modelcontextprotocol.io
   - GitHub Actions workflow with manual dry-run mode
   - Comprehensive test suite for workflow validation (50 tests)
   - Pinned mcp-publisher CLI to v1.3.3 for reproducibility

   ### Fixed
   - OAuth device flow zero-scopes bug (using OIDC instead)
   - 26 SonarCloud code quality issues in test files
   - Correct namespace casing for MCP registry (DollhouseMCP)

   ### Technical
   - OIDC permissions: id-token:write, contents:read
   - server.json included in NPM package
   - Works with release publish or manual workflow_dispatch
   ```

**Commit the version bump**:
```bash
git add package.json server.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.9.19

Prepare for patch release including MCP registry publishing workflow.

Changes:
- Update version to 1.9.19 in package.json and server.json
- Update CHANGELOG.md with v1.9.19 release notes"

git push origin develop
```

#### Phase 2: Create Release Branch (GitFlow)

```bash
# Create release branch from develop
git checkout -b release/1.9.19 develop

# Verify version is 1.9.19
grep '"version"' package.json
grep '"version"' server.json

# Push release branch
git push -u origin release/1.9.19
```

#### Phase 3: Test Workflow (Dry-Run on Release Branch)

**Now test the workflow with the correct version (1.9.19)**:

```bash
# Manually trigger workflow on release branch with dry-run
gh workflow run "Publish to MCP Registry" \
  --ref release/1.9.19 \
  --field dry_run=true

# Get the run ID
gh run list --workflow="Publish to MCP Registry" --limit 1 --json databaseId,status

# Watch the workflow
gh run watch <RUN_ID>

# After completion, check logs
gh run view <RUN_ID> --log
```

**Verify in logs**:
- ‚úÖ "Running in DRY-RUN mode" message
- ‚úÖ mcp-publisher v1.3.3 installed
- ‚úÖ OIDC login succeeded
- ‚úÖ Build succeeded
- ‚úÖ No actual publication (dry-run)
- ‚úÖ server.json version shows 1.9.19

**If workflow fails**: Fix on release branch, commit, push, test again.

#### Phase 4: Merge Release to Main

**Only proceed if dry-run test passed!**

```bash
# Checkout main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Merge release branch (no fast-forward for clean history)
git merge --no-ff release/1.9.19 -m "Release v1.9.19: MCP registry publishing workflow

Merging release/1.9.19 to main.

Major features:
- MCP registry publishing with OIDC authentication
- Automated workflow for registry.modelcontextprotocol.io
- Dry-run testing capability

# Tag the release
git tag -a v1.9.19 -m "Release v1.9.19

# Push main and tags
git push origin main
git push origin v1.9.19
```

#### Phase 5: Merge Back to Develop

```bash
# Checkout develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Merge main back to develop to sync any release-specific changes
git merge main -m "Merge main (v1.9.19 release) back to develop per GitFlow"

# Push develop
git push origin develop

# Delete release branch (optional, can wait)
git branch -d release/1.9.19
git push origin --delete release/1.9.19
```

#### Phase 6: Create GitHub Release

```bash
gh release create v1.9.19 \
  --title "v1.9.19 - MCP Registry Publishing" \
  --notes "## MCP Registry Publishing with OIDC

### What Changed
- Added \`.github/workflows/publish-mcp-registry.yml\`
- Added \`server.json\` with correct DollhouseMCP namespace casing
- Workflow triggers on release publish or manual dispatch
- Uses OIDC authentication instead of broken OAuth device flow

### Bug Fixes
- üêõ Resolved OAuth device flow zero-scopes bug
- üßπ Fixed 26 SonarCloud code quality issues

### Technical Details
- **OIDC Permissions**: \`id-token:write\`, \`contents:read\`

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md"
```

#### Phase 7: Publish to NPM

```bash
# On main branch, with v1.9.19 tagged
git checkout main

# Final verification
npm run build
npm test

# Publish to NPM (will trigger prepublishOnly script)
npm publish

# Verify publication
npm view @dollhousemcp/mcp-server version  # Should show 1.9.19
```

#### Phase 8: Verify MCP Registry Publication

**The workflow should auto-trigger on the GitHub release creation.**

```bash
# Check workflow runs
gh run list --workflow="Publish to MCP Registry" --limit 5

# Watch the automatic publication run
gh run watch <RUN_ID>

# After completion, verify at registry
open https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/
# Search for "DollhouseMCP" - should appear in results
```

## Key Points

1. **Version bump happens FIRST on develop** before creating release branch
2. **Test on release branch** (release/1.9.19) with dry-run mode
3. **Only merge to main if tests pass**
4. **Tag after merging to main**
5. **GitHub release triggers automatic MCP registry publication**
6. **Merge main back to develop** to complete the cycle

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT skip the version bump step** - it must happen before creating release branch
- **DO NOT test on develop** - testing happens on release branch
- **DO NOT manually publish to MCP registry** - the workflow handles this automatically on release
- **DO follow GitFlow** - release branches are created from develop, merged to main, then main merged back to develop
