# Session Notes - October 3, 2025

**Date**: October 3, 2025
**Time**: 1:50 PM - 3:45 PM (Approximately 2 hours)
**Focus**: Platform-agnostic documentation for DollhouseMCP
**Outcome**: ✅ Complete - Issue created, comprehensive documentation added, PR ready for review

## Session Summary

Addressed critical documentation issue where Gemini CLI and other MCP clients incorrectly perceived DollhouseMCP as Claude Desktop-exclusive. Created comprehensive platform-agnostic documentation with researched, accurate configuration examples for all confirmed working MCP clients.

## Problem Statement

User reported that Gemini CLI refused to help install DollhouseMCP because it believed the tool was designed exclusively for Claude Desktop. This was causing artificial barriers for users of other MCP-compatible clients (Gemini, Claude Code, Bolt AI).

**Root Cause**: Documentation heavily featured Claude Desktop-specific language without clearly stating platform-agnostic compatibility.

## Work Completed

### 1. Issue Creation
- **Created**: [Issue #1236](https://github.com/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server/issues/1236)
- **Title**: "Documentation incorrectly implies Claude Desktop exclusivity"
- **Labels**: documentation, bug
- **Impact**: Documented problem and expected outcome

### 2. Initial Documentation Updates (Commit 1)

**Files Modified**:
- `README.md` - Updated installation section
- `src/config/ConfigManager.ts` - Updated comment (line 11)
- `src/portfolio/PortfolioManager.ts` - Updated comment (line 177)

**Key Changes**:
- Added "MCP Client Compatibility" section listing multiple clients
- Updated all "Configure Claude Desktop" headers to "Configure Your MCP Client"
- Changed "Claude Desktop integration" to "MCP client integration" throughout
- Made troubleshooting platform-agnostic with client-specific guidance
- Expanded External Resources to include Claude Code, Gemini

**Commit Hash**: `1d6dbdd1`

### 3. Research Phase

User correctly challenged to "properly research" instead of making assumptions. Conducted web searches for accurate configuration details:

**Research Sources**:
- **Claude Code**:
  - docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp
  - scottspence.com (configuration best practices)
  - mcpcat.io/guides
  - Discovered CLI wizard, config scopes (~/.claude.json, .mcp.json)

- **Gemini CLI**:
  - github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
  - google-gemini.github.io/gemini-cli
  - Discovered JSON-RPC handshake, timeout configuration, CLI commands

- **Bolt AI**:
  - docs.boltai.com
  - Discovered import feature, iOS limitations, mcp.json location

### 4. Enhanced Documentation (Commit 2)

**New File Created**:
- `docs/guides/MCP_CLIENT_SETUP.md` (420+ lines)

**Comprehensive Setup Guide Includes**:

**Claude Desktop** (already working):
- Standard installation methods
- Config file locations by platform
- Full troubleshooting section

**Claude Code** (researched):
- CLI wizard method: `claude mcp add dollhousemcp --scope user`
- Manual configuration with scopes (user/project/local)
- Config locations: `~/.claude.json`, `.mcp.json`
- CLI commands for management
- Scope-specific troubleshooting

**Gemini CLI** (researched):
- CLI method: `gemini mcp add dollhousemcp dollhousemcp`
- Manual configuration with full options (timeout, cwd, env)
- JSON-RPC handshake explanation
- stdio transport details
- Comprehensive troubleshooting

**Bolt AI** (researched):
- Import from Claude Desktop/Cursor feature
- Manual mcp.json configuration
- macOS vs iOS differences
- iOS limitation: remote servers only
- Plugin dropdown usage

**Advanced Sections**:
- Multiple configurations for different portfolios
- Environment variable customization
- npx latest version usage
- Platform-specific notes (macOS/Windows/Linux)
- Common issues across all clients
- Path and permission troubleshooting

**README Enhancements**:
- Added "Confirmed Working Clients" list with checkmarks
- Expanded quick-link sections with recommended methods
- Added proper config file locations for each client
- Included CLI commands where applicable
- Added links to detailed setup guide
- Noted platform-specific limitations

**Commit Hash**: `a2b70646`

### 5. Pull Request

**Created**: [PR #1237](https://github.com/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server/pull/1237)
- **Base**: develop
- **Title**: "docs: Make DollhouseMCP platform-agnostic, not Claude Desktop-only"
- **Status**: Ready for review
- **Commits**: 2 (base + enhancements)

## Key Learnings

### Documentation Best Practices

1. **Research First, Never Assume**: Initially started with generic examples, user correctly pushed back requiring actual research
2. **Cite Sources**: Added research sources to commit messages for verification
3. **Platform-Agnostic Language**: Replace client-specific language with generic "MCP client" terminology
4. **Provide Specifics**: Give actual config file locations, CLI commands, real examples
5. **Multiple Methods**: Document both recommended (CLI) and manual (config file) approaches

### MCP Client Ecosystem Understanding

**Confirmed Working**:
- Claude Desktop (stdio, JSON config)
- Claude Code (CLI wizard + config scopes)
- Gemini CLI (CLI command + JSON-RPC)
- Bolt AI (import feature + mcp.json)

**Common Patterns**:
- All use stdio transport
- All use JSON-RPC communication
- Most support `mcpServers` configuration format
- Many offer both CLI and manual config methods

**Key Differences**:
- Config file locations vary by client
- Claude Code has scope system (user/project/local)
- Gemini CLI has explicit timeout configuration
- Bolt AI iOS requires remote servers only
- Bolt AI can import from other clients

### Git Workflow

1. **Proper Branch Naming**: Used `feature/platform-agnostic-docs` instead of unrelated branch
2. **Incremental Commits**: Two commits - base changes, then researched enhancements
3. **Clear Commit Messages**: Included "what/why/impact" in messages
4. **PR Communication**: Added detailed comment explaining enhancements

4. **SEO/Discoverability**: More clients mentioned = more search visibility

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Initial Assumptions**: Started with made-up configs, correctly challenged by user
2. **Research Quality**: Had to search official docs to get accurate information
3. **Documentation Scope**: Balance between README brevity and comprehensive guide
4. **Context Management**: Session approaching token limits, needed to wrap up

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Review PR #1237**: Address any feedback from code review
2. **Test Configurations**: Ideally verify configs work with each client
3. **Update CHANGELOG**: Add entry for documentation improvements
4. **Consider Examples**: Maybe add real-world configuration files in examples/ directory
5. **Version Bump**: Consider if this warrants a documentation-only release

## Statistics
