# Next Priorities - July 23, 2025

## Just Completed âœ…
- **Security Issue #206**: Comprehensive error message sanitization (PR #374 merged)
- All error handling throughout codebase is now secure
- Pre-compiled regex patterns for performance
- Enhanced coverage for edge cases

## Immediate Next Tasks

### 1. Check PR #359 (Ensemble Element)
Last session this was ready to merge but had Windows CI issues
```bash
gh pr view 359
gh pr checks 359
```

### 2. Issue #372: Create Default Elements for All Types
User mentioned this as next priority. Need to create default/starter elements:
- Default personas (e.g., "Assistant", "Creative Writer", "Developer")
- Default skills (e.g., "Code Review", "Translation", "Research")
- Default templates (e.g., "Meeting Notes", "Report", "Email")
- Default agents (e.g., "Task Manager", "Research Assistant")
- Default memories (e.g., "Project Context", "User Preferences")
- Default ensembles (e.g., "Development Team", "Writing Suite")

Architecture note from user: These should be static defaults that ship with the package, not user-modifiable.

### 3. Security Issues Remaining
Several security issues are still open:
- #153: Implement secure session management
- #154: Add audit logging for security events
- #155: Implement secure key storage
- #156: Add input validation middleware
- #157: Implement secure file upload
- #158: Add CSRF protection
- #159: Implement secure password reset

### 4. Element System Enhancements
After ensemble is merged:
- Element factory pattern (#362)
- Cross-element references
- Element composition improvements
- Performance optimizations

## Quick Status Check Commands
```bash
# See what's changed
git checkout main
git pull
git log --oneline -10

# Check issues
gh issue list --label "priority: high" --limit 10
gh issue list --label "security" --limit 10

# Check PRs
gh pr list --limit 5
```

## Notes
- Context was at 8% when finishing security work
- User was very pleased with security implementation
- Ready to move on to next priorities
- Element system is mostly complete (just ensemble pending)
