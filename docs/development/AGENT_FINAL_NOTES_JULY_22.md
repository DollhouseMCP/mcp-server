# Agent Implementation - Final Notes for Next Session

## The One Failing Test
**File**: `test/__tests__/unit/elements/agents/Agent.test.ts`  
**Test**: "should validate max concurrent goals"  
**Issue**: Expecting `maxConcurrentGoals: 0` to throw, but it's not throwing

**Likely cause**: In the constructor, we default to `AGENT_DEFAULTS.MAX_CONCURRENT_GOALS` if undefined, but 0 is falsy so might be getting replaced by the default.

**Fix to try**:
```typescript
// In Agent.ts constructor, around line 47
maxConcurrentGoals: metadata.maxConcurrentGoals ?? AGENT_DEFAULTS.MAX_CONCURRENT_GOALS
// Using ?? instead of || to preserve 0
```

## Windows CI Consideration
The user mentioned potential regex path issues on Windows. Keep an eye on CI after the test fix - might need to escape backslashes in file paths.

## PR #349 Status
- All functionality complete
- All review items addressed
- Just waiting on:
  1. One test fix
  2. CI to pass
  3. Review approval

## Memory Element Planning
Next priority after Agent merge. Already have comprehensive guide in:
- `/docs/development/NEXT_ELEMENT_MEMORY.md`
- Key features: backends, retention policies, privacy levels, search

## Important Patterns Established
1. **Race condition fix**: Use `fs.open(path, 'wx')` for atomic file creation
2. **Configuration extraction**: Separate config files for complex constants
3. **Template systems**: Pre-defined patterns for common use cases
4. **Performance tracking**: Minimal overhead timing with Date.now()
5. **Cycle detection**: DFS with recursion stack
