# Context for Session Compaction - July 9, 2025

## 🧠 Key Mental Model

**Current Situation**: We have FIVE branches with security work:
1. Two PRs submitted and waiting for ClaudeBot review
2. Three branches ready to submit as PRs when bot returns
3. All implementations 100% complete and tested

## 🎯 The One Thing to Remember

```bash
# This command tells you everything:
gh pr list --json number,title,headRefName,mergeable
```

If you see PR #156 and #160, they're waiting for review.
If you don't see SEC-003/004/005 PRs, they need to be created.

## 🔧 What We Fixed Today

1. **Timing Test** - Was failing randomly, now uses statistical approach
2. **Security Monitor Test** - Was expecting 3 logs, actually logs 5
3. **CI Environment Test** - NODE_ENV isn't always set in CI

These fixes are in PR #160, which is why all CI is now green.

## 📝 Critical File Locations

```
# Security implementations
/src/security/contentValidator.ts       → SEC-001 (PR #156)
/src/security/secureYamlParser.ts      → SEC-003 (ready)
/src/security/SecureTokenManager.ts    → SEC-004 (ready)
/src/security/SecurityError.ts         → SEC-004 (ready)
Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml        → SEC-005 (ready)

# Test that was flaky
/__tests__/unit/InputValidator.test.ts → Fixed in PR #160
```

## 🚨 Don't Forget

1. **Check ClaudeBot first** - No point doing anything if bot is still down
2. **Submit PRs in order** - SEC-003 → SEC-005 → SEC-004
3. **Don't merge locally** - Always use PR process
4. **NPM publish after** - Version 1.2.1 is ready once security is merged

## 💭 Context Lost in Compaction

- We tried to trigger ClaudeBot by adding a documentation comment
- The bot seems to need Anthropic's API to be fully operational
- All security work was split across 3 sessions today
- SEC-002 was proven to be a false positive (already uses spawn, not exec)

## 🎉 What Success Looks Like

```bash
# When you see this, you've won:
gh pr list --state merged | grep -E "SEC-00[1345]|timing" | wc -l
# Should output: 5
```

Then npm publish v1.2.1 and you're done!
