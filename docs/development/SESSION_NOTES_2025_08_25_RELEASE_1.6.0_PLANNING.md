# Session Notes - August 25, 2025 - v1.6.0 Release Planning

**Date**: Sunday, August 25, 2025  
**Time**: ~10:30 AM - 11:15 AM  
**Focus**: v1.6.0 release preparation and planning  
**Context**: ~97% usage - approaching limit  

## Session Summary

Focused on preparing for the v1.6.0 release. Fixed a critical bug in the `get_build_info` tool (PR #726) and reviewed release requirements. Session ended with context limitations requiring validation of which issues have been resolved.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed get_build_info Tool (PR #726) ✅
- **Problem**: Tool was returning plain string instead of MCP format, causing Claude Desktop to hang
- **Solution**: Wrapped return value in proper MCP response format: `{ content: [{ type: "text", text: "..." }] }`
- **Testing**: Updated all 34 tests to expect MCP format
- **Status**: Merged successfully, confirmed working in Claude Desktop
- **Impact**: Resolves hanging issue, tool now provides comprehensive build information

### 2. Release Status Review ✅
- **Current Version**: Package.json already at 1.6.0
- **Branch**: On develop, with latest changes merged
- **Documentation**: Reviewed session notes from August 19 about release prep

## Release 1.6.0 Status

### Confirmed Changes (in CHANGELOG as Unreleased)
1. **Collection Submission Workflow** (#549) - Complete
2. **Removed Deprecated Marketplace Aliases** (#548) - BREAKING CHANGE
3. **YAML Bomb Detection** (#364) - Security fix

### Additional Changes (Need to add to CHANGELOG)
1. **get_build_info Tool Fix** (PR #726) - Fixed MCP response format

### Issues Requiring Validation

**IMPORTANT**: These issues were identified but may already be fixed. Need to validate status in next session:

#### Critical Priority (Need Verification)
- #706: Unicode validation blocking element search
- #705: [object Object] parameter parsing errors  
- #704: OAuth token persistence after device flow

#### High Priority (Need Verification)
- #708: Collection browser returning 0 items
- #707: OAuth token status tool needed
- #709: Session state management for OAuth

### Documentation Status
From August 19 session notes:
- UpdateTools removed (PR #634) - Reduced tool count 56 → 51
- PersonaTools partial removal planned (Issue #633)
- Tool consolidation analysis completed

## Next Session Requirements

### 1. Validation Tasks
**Must verify which issues are actually fixed:**
```bash
# Check recent PRs merged to develop
git log --oneline develop --since="2025-08-20" --grep="fix"

# Check specific issue status
gh issue view 706  # Unicode validation
gh issue view 705  # Parameter parsing
gh issue view 704  # OAuth persistence
gh issue view 708  # Collection browser

# Verify current tool count
# Count actual tools registered in server
```

### 2. CHANGELOG Updates Needed
- Move "Unreleased" section to v1.6.0
- Add get_build_info fix (PR #726)
- Verify all merged PRs are documented
- Document actual tool count after all changes

### 3. Release Checklist Items
Per `/docs/development/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`:
- [ ] Verify all tests passing
- [ ] Run security audit
- [ ] Update tool count in README
- [ ] Document breaking changes
- [ ] Create migration guide for removed tools
- [ ] Test roundtrip workflow

### 4. Decision Points
1. **Critical Bugs**: Determine which (if any) of the identified issues need fixing before release
2. **Prompts Element Type**: User mentioned experimental work on prompts - include in 1.6.0?
3. **Release Branch**: Create from develop once ready

## Technical Context

### Current Tool Count Confusion
- August 19 notes say 56 → 51 after UpdateTools removal
- Need to verify actual count with all changes
- BuildInfoTools still exists and works (just fixed)

### Experimental Work
- User mentioned working on prompts as element type in experimental repo
- May be merged soon - consider for 1.6.0 inclusion

## Files Modified This Session

### Fixed
- `/src/server/tools/BuildInfoTools.ts` - Added MCP response format
- `/test/__tests__/unit/server/tools/BuildInfoTools.test.ts` - Updated for MCP format

### Created
- This session notes file

## Session End State
- **Branch**: develop (up to date)
- **PR #726**: Merged successfully
- **Context**: ~97% used, ending session
- **Next Step**: New session to validate issue status and continue release prep

## Priority for Next Session

1. **Validate which critical issues are already fixed**
2. **Update CHANGELOG with all changes**
3. **Verify tool count and update documentation**
4. **Decide on including prompts element type**
5. **Create release branch if ready**

## Key Learning

When preparing releases with high context usage, it's important to validate current state rather than rely on potentially outdated documentation. Several issues identified as "critical" may already be resolved in recent PRs.
