**Outcome**: âœ… Release PR created, ready for merge

## Session Summary

Successfully executed the v1.9.19 release plan to recover from the botched v1.9.18 release. Created PR #1371 with all 90 commits from develop that were stranded after the improper v1.9.18 hotfix.

## Work Completed

### 1. Fixed Failing Test
- Created fix/mcp-registry-workflow-shell branch
- Added missing `shell: bash` declarations to publish-mcp-registry.yml
- Created PR #1370, passed all CI checks, merged to develop

### 2. Prepared Release
- Reset premature version bump from develop
- Created fresh release/1.9.19 branch from develop
- Version already at 1.9.19 from earlier bump
- Updated CHANGELOG with comprehensive notes for all 90 commits

### 3. Created Release PR
- PR #1371: release/1.9.19 â†’ main
- Includes ALL work since v1.9.18 divergence
- Major features:
  - MCP registry publishing with OIDC
  - PostHog telemetry integration
  - Enhanced security (AES-256 encryption)
  - Dual licensing model
  - 90 commits of fixes and improvements

## Key Actions Taken

1. **Proper GitFlow Process**:
   - Fix branch â†’ PR â†’ merge to develop
   - Release branch from develop â†’ PR to main
   - No shortcuts or hotfixes

2. **Comprehensive Documentation**:
   - CHANGELOG updated with all 90 commits categorized
   - PR description clear about scope and actions

3. **Clean Recovery**:
   - No more direct commits to develop
   - Proper branch management
   - Following established procedures

## Current Status

- **PR #1370**: âœ… Merged (workflow fix)
- **PR #1371**: ðŸš€ Created, awaiting CI and merge
- **Next Steps**:
  1. Monitor CI checks on PR #1371
  2. Merge to main (DO NOT SQUASH)
  3. Create git tag v1.9.19
  4. Publish to NPM
  5. Create GitHub release
  6. Sync main back to develop

## Issues Resolved

- Fixed failing github-workflow-validation test
- Recovered from v1.9.18 release disaster
- Synchronized develop and main branches (pending merge)
- Restored proper GitFlow process

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Complete Release**:
   - Monitor and merge PR #1371
   - Create tag and GitHub release
   - Publish to NPM
   - Verify MCP registry update

2. **Post-Release**:
   - Sync main back to develop
   - Clean up release branch
   - Verify everything is synchronized

## Lessons Reinforced

1. **Never bypass GitFlow** - Always use proper branches
2. **Fix branches for fixes** - Don't commit directly to develop
3. **Document everything** - Clear PR descriptions and changelogs
4. **Test before release** - Fix failing tests first
