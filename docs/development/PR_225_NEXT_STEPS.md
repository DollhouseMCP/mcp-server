# PR #225 Next Steps

## Current Status
- All critical security vulnerabilities fixed
- Most test issues resolved
- CI running latest changes
- Received excellent reviews (5 stars)

## Potential Remaining Issues

### 1. Path Traversal Tests
The path traversal tests in `mcp-tools-security.test.ts` may still be failing because they expect errors but the payloads might be getting sanitized instead. Need to update similar to command injection tests.

### 2. Special Character Tests
Some special character tests may need adjustment based on what characters are actually problematic vs just sanitized.

### 3. Edit Success Message
Consider showing both original and sanitized values in edit success message:
```
ðŸ”„ **New Value:** ; rm -rf / â†’ rm -rf / (sanitized)
```

### 4. Non-Existent Security Classes
`security-validators.test.ts` tests classes that don't exist:
- SecureYamlParser
- PathValidator
- YamlValidator
These are test infrastructure issues, not security issues.

## Quick Fixes if Tests Still Fail

### For Path Traversal Tests:
```typescript
// Update to handle both rejection and sanitization
if (responseText.includes('Error') || responseText.includes('not found')) {
  // Good - path was rejected
  expect(responseText).toMatch(/not found|invalid|error/i);
} else {
  // Check that dangerous paths were sanitized
  // Extract actual path used
  const pathMatch = responseText.match(/some-pattern/);
  expect(pathMatch?.[1]).not.toContain('..');
}
```

### For Special Character Tests:
Some characters might be allowed (like ANSI escape sequences in certain contexts). May need to adjust expectations based on actual security requirements.

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Check specific test locally
npm test -- __tests__/security/tests/mcp-tools-security.test.ts -t "specific test name"

# Run all security tests
npm test -- __tests__/security/

# Check what's actually happening with a payload
node -e "
import { DollhouseMCPServer } from './dist/index.js';
// Test specific payload
"
```

## If CI Still Fails
1. Check the specific error in CI logs
2. Look for pattern differences between local and CI
3. Consider if it's a timing issue (add small delays)
4. Check if it's a path resolution issue
5. Verify test cleanup is working properly

## Documentation TODO
Once PR #225 is merged:
1. Update main security documentation
2. Add security testing guide to contributor docs
3. Document the security improvements in changelog
4. Consider blog post about security testing approach
