# Session Notes - July 29, 2025 - NPM Release Workflow Fix

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
The NPM release workflow failed for v1.3.1 because CI environment tests expected `TEST_PERSONAS_DIR` to be set, but this environment variable wasn't configured in the release workflow.

### Solution Implemented
Added to `.github/workflows/release-npm.yml`:
1. Set `TEST_PERSONAS_DIR` environment variable at job level
2. Added "Prepare test environment" step to create the directory

### Changes Made
- Commit: ac6c718 - "fix: Add TEST_PERSONAS_DIR to NPM release workflow"
- Pushed to develop branch

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Re-run Release Workflow ‚ùå NOT AVAILABLE
The release workflow doesn't have `workflow_dispatch` trigger, so it cannot be manually re-run.
We need to either create a new release or manually publish.

### Option 2: Create a New Release
If re-running doesn't work, create v1.3.2 with the fix:

```bash
# Create release branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b release/v1.3.2

# Bump version
npm version patch
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore: Bump version to 1.3.2"

# Create PR
gh pr create --base main --title "Release v1.3.2" --body "NPM release workflow fix"

# After merge, tag and push
git tag v1.3.2
git push origin v1.3.2
```

### Option 3: Manual NPM Publish
If automation continues to fail:

```bash
# Ensure you're on the v1.3.1 tag
git checkout v1.3.1

# Build and publish
npm run build
npm publish --access public
```

## Verification

After successful publish:
```bash
# Check NPM
npm view @dollhousemcp/mcp-server

# Should show version 1.3.1 (or 1.3.2 if you created new release)
```

## Future Improvements

Consider creating a test profile that excludes CI-specific tests for release workflows:
- Create `jest.config.release.js` that excludes CI environment tests
- Update release workflow to use `npm test -- --config=jest.config.release.js`

## Status
- ‚úÖ Fix implemented and pushed to develop
- ‚è≥ Awaiting re-run of release workflow or new release
- üì¶ v1.3.1 package ready for NPM (279.3 kB)
