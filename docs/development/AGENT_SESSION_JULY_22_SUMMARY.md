# Agent Implementation Session Summary - July 22, 2025

## Quick Status
- **PR #349**: All review improvements implemented ✅
- **Tests**: 45/46 passing (1 minor fix needed)
- **CI**: Should be green after minor test fix
- **Ready for**: Final test fix, then review approval

## What We Did Today

1. **Resolved merge conflict** in PR #349
2. **Implemented ALL review recommendations**:
   - ✅ Fixed race condition (HIGH)
   - ✅ Added validation (MEDIUM)
   - ✅ Added cycle detection (MEDIUM)
   - ✅ Added performance metrics (MEDIUM)
   - ✅ Extracted constants (LOW)
   - ✅ Added templates (LOW)

## One Small Issue Left

The test "should validate max concurrent goals" is failing because when we pass `maxConcurrentGoals: 0`, it might be getting converted or ignored. Need to check the sanitization logic.

## Next Session Priority

1. Fix the one failing test (5 minutes)
2. Check CI status
3. Wait for review approval
4. After merge: Start Memory element
