# Session Notes - August 1, 2025 - Element System MCP Tools

## Context
- **Issue**: NPM package v1.3.2 only exposed personas, not the full element system
- **Problem**: Backend had all 6 element types implemented but MCP tools were persona-only
- **Solution**: Created generic element tools to expose the portfolio system

## What We Did

### 1. Fixed NPM Release Workflow ✅
- Added NPM_TOKEN to GitHub secrets (was missing)
- Re-ran v1.3.2 release workflow - successfully published to NPM

### 2. Created Issue #404 ✅
- "CRITICAL: Expose element system through MCP tools"
- Documents the disconnect between backend and user-facing tools

### 3. Implemented Element Tools ✅
**Created**: `src/server/tools/ElementTools.ts`
- 6 generic tools: list_elements, activate_element, get_active_elements, deactivate_element, get_element_details, reload_elements
- 2 specific tools: render_template, execute_agent
- Total tools increased from 23 to 30

### 4. CRITICAL IP Removal ✅
**Removed entirely due to patent restrictions**:
- `src/elements/memories/` directory
- `src/elements/ensembles/` directory
- ElementType.MEMORY and ElementType.ENSEMBLE from enum
- All references throughout codebase

**Remaining element types**: personas, skills, templates, agents

### 5. Documentation Updates ✅
- Added "Portfolio Customization Elements" section to README
- Explained 4 element types (not 6)
- Updated tool count to 30
- Added examples for new tools

### 6. Created PR #405 ✅
- Branch: `feature/expose-element-mcp-tools`
- Target: develop (following GitFlow)
- Ready for review and merge

## Current State
- On branch: `feature/expose-element-mcp-tools`
- PR #405 created and ready
- v1.3.2 is live on NPM (but without element tools)
- Next release should be v1.3.3 with element tools

## Next Steps for Release
1. Get PR #405 reviewed and merged to develop
2. Create release/v1.3.3 branch from develop
3. Bump version to 1.3.3
4. Update CHANGELOG
5. Create PR from release/v1.3.3 to main
6. After merge, tag will trigger NPM release

## Important Notes
- **IP Restriction**: Memories and Ensembles CANNOT be included (patent pending)
- **Backward Compatibility**: All persona tools still work
- **Tool Count**: Now 30 tools (was 23)
- **GitFlow**: Following proper process (feature → develop → release → main)

## Commands to Continue
```bash
# Check PR status
gh pr view 405
