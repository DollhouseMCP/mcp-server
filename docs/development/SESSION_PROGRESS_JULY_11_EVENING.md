# Session Progress - July 11, 2025 Evening

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. Repository Configuration Fixed
- Updated git remote from old `persona-mcp-server` to `DollhouseMCP/mcp-server`
- Successfully pulled latest changes including PR #209 (Security Implementation)
- Verified all security scripts are available (`npm run security:rapid`)

### 2. Security Implementation Verified
- All 28 security tests passing
- Security validators properly integrated:
  - CommandValidator: Command whitelisting and safe execution
  - PathValidator: Path traversal protection
  - YamlValidator: YAML bomb and XSS protection

### 3. Created Follow-up Issues
Based on PR #209 review recommendations:
- **Issue #216**: Verify CodeQL security scanning passes on main branch (HIGH)
- **Issue #217**: Add integration tests for security validators (MEDIUM)
- **Issue #218**: Implement performance monitoring for security validators (LOW)
- **Issue #219**: Implement validation caching to improve performance (LOW)
- **Issue #220**: Add security metrics and attack detection tracking (LOW)
- **Issue #221**: Fix potential race condition in PathValidator initialization (MEDIUM)

## Current Status ðŸ”„

### CodeQL Security Alerts
Found 4 open security alerts in `/src/security/yamlValidator.ts`:
- All related to incomplete HTML sanitization using regex
- CodeQL recommends using proper sanitization libraries
- These need to be fixed (Issue #216)

### High Priority Security Issues
1. **Issue #204**: File Locking - Prevent race conditions in concurrent operations
2. **Issue #202**: Token Security - Secure GitHub API token handling

## Next Steps ðŸ“‹

### Immediate Priority
1. Fix CodeQL alerts in yamlValidator.ts (Issue #216)
   - Replace regex-based HTML sanitization with a proper library
   - Consider DOMPurify or sanitize-html

2. Implement file locking (Issue #204)
   - Create FileLockManager class
   - Add locking to all file operations
   - Implement atomic writes

3. Implement token security (Issue #202)
   - Create TokenManager class
   - Add token validation and redaction
   - Implement scope verification

### Commands for Next Session
```bash
# Check CodeQL alerts
gh api repos/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server/code-scanning/alerts?state=open

# View high priority issues
gh issue list --label "priority: high" --state open

# Start work on file locking
gh issue view 204
```

## Notes
