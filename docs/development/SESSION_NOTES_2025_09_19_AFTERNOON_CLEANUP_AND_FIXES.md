# Session Notes - September 19, 2025 Afternoon - Repository Cleanup and CI Fixes

**Date**: September 19, 2025
**Time**: 1:50 PM - 2:30 PM PST
**Context**: Repository maintenance, CI fixes, and DollhouseMCP infrastructure improvements
**Persona**: alex-sterling v2.1 (Evidence-based verification approach)

## Session Objectives
1. Clean up main branch repository
2. Fix Windows CI flaky test
3. Organize Docker test files
4. Update DollhouseMCP to latest version
5. Address orphaned process issue

## Completed Work

### 1. Windows CI Flaky Test Fix (PR #1015) ✅
**Problem**: ToolCache performance test failing on Windows CI when execution took 76ms (threshold was 75ms)

**Solution**:
- Increased Windows CI performance threshold from 75ms to 100ms
- Created clean hotfix branch with single commit
- Merged successfully into main

**Files Modified**:
- `test/__tests__/unit/utils/ToolCache.test.ts` - Lines 212 and 301

**Follow-up**: Created Issue #1017 for investigating Windows CI performance test flakiness

### 2. Docker Test Files Organization (PR #1016) ✅
**Problem**: Test Docker files cluttering repository root directory

**Initial Issue**: Moved files without updating references, breaking scripts

**Complete Solution**:
1. Moved files from root to `docker/test-configs/`:
   - `.dockerignore.claude-testing`
   - `Dockerfile.claude-testing`
   - `Dockerfile.claude-testing.optimized`
   - `docker-compose.test.yml`

2. Updated all references (13 references across 9 files):
   - Scripts: `test-claude-docker.sh`, `claude-docker.sh`, `run-test-environment.sh`
   - Tests: `integration-tests.sh`
   - Documentation: Multiple MD files
   - Docker Compose: Updated context to `../..`

**Critical Learning**: Always verify path references when moving files!

### 3. Orphaned Process Discovery and Cleanup ✅
**Discovery**: Found 33 orphaned DollhouseMCP processes dating back to September 6th
- 10 processes from `mcp-server/dist/index.js`
- 23 processes from `experimental-server/dist/index.js`

**Immediate Action**: Killed all orphaned processes

**Created Issue #1018**: "Feature: Implement orphaned process cleanup on startup"
- Proposed solutions: PID files, process discovery, heartbeat, parent monitoring
- Priority: High (resource leak affecting all users)

### 4. DollhouseMCP Production Update ✅
**Current Setup Verified**:
- Production path: `/Users/mick/.dollhouse/claudecode-production/`
- Properly isolated from development directory
- Running as NPM package (not from source)

**Update Completed**:
- Updated from v1.8.1 to v1.9.0
- Used `npm update @dollhousemcp/mcp-server`
- Ready to activate on Claude Code restart

## Key Insights

### Repository Organization
- Test files belong in subdirectories, not root
- Moving files requires systematic reference updates
- Documentation and scripts often have hardcoded paths

### CI/CD Observations
- Windows CI has different performance characteristics
- Performance tests in CI are inherently flaky
- Threshold-based tests need platform-specific values

### Process Management Issues
- MCP servers don't clean up when parent process dies
- Orphaned processes accumulate over time
- Need automatic cleanup mechanism

### Development vs Production Separation
- Critical to keep production MCP separate from development
- Use NPM packages for production, not source directories
- NPX might be even better for automatic updates

## Next Session Plan (v1.9.1 Development)

### Primary Goal: Implement Orphaned Process Cleanup
1. Start fresh with DollhouseMCP v1.9.0
2. Implement parent process monitoring solution
3. Test with simulated crashes
4. Create v1.9.1 release

### Implementation Strategy
```javascript
// Recommended approach - Parent Process Monitoring
process.on('disconnect', () => {
  console.log('Parent process disconnected, cleaning up...');
  process.exit(0);
});

// Check if parent is still alive periodically
setInterval(() => {
  try {
    process.kill(process.ppid, 0);
  } catch (e) {
    console.log('Parent process died, exiting...');
    process.exit(0);
  }
}, 5000);
```

## Metrics
- PRs Created: 2 (#1015, #1016)
- PRs Merged: 2
- Issues Created: 2 (#1017, #1018)
- Orphaned Processes Cleaned: 33
- Version Update: 1.8.1 → 1.9.0

## Files for Reference
- `/Users/mick/.dollhouse/claudecode-production/` - Production DollhouseMCP installation
- `test/__tests__/unit/utils/ToolCache.test.ts` - Flaky test location
- `docker/test-configs/` - New location for Docker test files
- Issue #1018 - Orphaned process cleanup feature request

## Session End State
- Repository main branch is clean
- All CI checks passing (with increased Windows threshold)
- Docker test files properly organized
- DollhouseMCP v1.9.0 installed (pending restart)
- Ready for v1.9.1 development in next session
