# Session Notes - September 10, 2025 Evening - PR Management & Testing

## Session Overview
**Time**: ~1:30 PM - 2:06 PM PST  
**Context**: PR review, retargeting, merging, and Docker testing  
**Main Achievement**: Successfully handled PR #916 and #917, fixed test failures  

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. PR #916 - Hotfix Management âœ…

#### Initial State
- PR #916 was a "hotfix" targeting `main` branch
- Contained 1,688 lines of changes (too large for hotfix)
- Debug Detective correctly identified it as a feature disguised as hotfix

#### Actions Taken
1. **Retargeted PR from main â†’ develop**
   ```bash
   gh pr edit 916 --base develop
   ```
   - Successfully changed target branch without recreating PR
   - Followed proper GitFlow (features/fixes go to develop first)

2. **Resolved Merge Conflicts**
   - Merged develop into hotfix branch
   - Fixed conflicts in `src/index.ts`
   - Removed ConfigWizard references (not in hotfix)
   - Fixed setupServer call to use 2-parameter signature

3. **Merged PR #916 to develop**
   - All 13 CI checks passed
   - Merged at 17:43:40 UTC
   - Commit: `8882773cfc7fba41368ecb837579ebf018426ccb`

#### What PR #916 Included
- Fix for sync_portfolio upload failure (#913)
- Fix for template variable interpolation (#914)
- TemplateRenderer refactoring to dedicated utility
- Unicode normalization security improvements (DMCP-SEC-004)
- 870+ lines of comprehensive tests

### 2. Test Failures Fixed âœ…

#### Problem Discovered
After merging PR #916, Extended Node Compatibility tests were failing on develop.

#### Root Causes
1. **TemplateRenderer test "render method deletion"**
   - `delete` doesn't work on prototype methods
   - Test was incorrectly trying to delete instance method
   
2. **TemplateRenderer batch rendering test**
   - Real Template instances weren't mocked properly
   - Render methods needed explicit Jest mocks

#### GitFlow Violation & Correction
**MISTAKE**: Initially pushed fix directly to develop (violation!)

**CORRECTION**:
1. Reset develop to before direct commit
2. Created proper fix branch `fix/template-renderer-tests`
3. Cherry-picked test fix
4. Created PR #917 following proper workflow

### 3. PR #917 - Test Fixes âœ…

#### Proper GitFlow Process
1. Created fix branch from develop
2. Applied test fixes:
   - Set `render = undefined` instead of `delete`
   - Added proper Jest mocks for Template render methods
   - Updated expected error messages
3. Created PR to develop
4. All 13 CI checks passed
5. Merged successfully at 17:58:42 UTC

### 4. Docker Testing Attempt ðŸ”„

#### What We Did
1. Verified on correct branch (develop)
2. Built project with `npm run build`
3. Created Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t dollhousemcp:develop-latest -f docker/Dockerfile . --no-cache
   ```
4. Attempted to run container for testing

#### Docker Build Success
- Multi-stage build completed successfully
- Security hardening applied (non-root user, etc.)
- Image created: `dollhousemcp:develop-latest`

#### Testing Challenge
- MCP servers are stdio-based, not daemon-based
- Initial attempt with `-it` flag failed (not a TTY in Docker context)
- Need proper Claude Code Docker test setup documentation

## Current State of develop Branch

### Includes All Fixes
- âœ… Template rendering fixes from PR #916
- âœ… sync_portfolio upload fixes from PR #916
- âœ… Unicode security improvements from PR #916
- âœ… Test corrections from PR #917
- âœ… All CI checks passing

### Ready for Release
- Build successful: v1.7.3
- Docker image builds successfully
- All tests passing in CI
- No known blockers

## GitFlow Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. Initially pushed directly to develop (violation!)
2. Almost merged a "hotfix" to main that was really a feature

### What We Did Right
1. Caught and corrected GitFlow violations immediately
2. Properly retargeted PR from main to develop
3. Created fix branch and PR for test fixes
4. Reset branch when mistakes were made
5. Followed proper PR â†’ review â†’ merge workflow

### Key GitFlow Rules Reinforced
- **NEVER** push directly to develop or main
- **ALWAYS** create feature/fix branches
- **ALWAYS** create PRs for review
- Hotfixes to main should be minimal (not 1,688 lines!)
- Features and fixes go to develop first

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. **Complete Docker Testing**
   - Find/create proper Docker Claude Code test documentation
   - Test DollhouseMCP in Claude Code within Docker
   - Verify all MCP tools work correctly

2. **Consider Release**
   - develop branch is stable with all fixes
   - Could create release/v1.7.4 branch
   - Would include all template and sync fixes

### Testing Requirements Before Release
- [ ] Test sync_portfolio upload with real GitHub
- [ ] Test template rendering with variables
- [ ] Verify Unicode normalization works
- [ ] Run full integration test suite
- [ ] Test in Claude Desktop (not just Docker)

## Technical Details

### Files Modified in Session
1. `src/index.ts` - Merge conflict resolution
2. `test/__tests__/unit/utils/TemplateRenderer.test.ts` - Test fixes
3. `src/portfolio/PortfolioSyncManager.ts` - From PR #916
4. `src/utils/TemplateRenderer.ts` - From PR #916

### Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Get latest develop
cd /Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Check CI status
gh run list --branch develop --limit 5

# Continue Docker testing
docker run --rm dollhousemcp:develop-latest node dist/index.js

# Create release branch when ready
git checkout -b release/v1.7.4
```

## Metrics

- **PRs Handled**: 2 (#916, #917)
- **Commits**: 8+ (including merges)
- **Tests Fixed**: 2 critical test failures
- **CI Runs**: All passing (26/26 checks total)
- **Docker Builds**: 1 successful
- **Time Spent**: ~36 minutes active work

## Summary

Successful session with proper GitFlow enforcement, critical bug fixes merged, and test failures resolved. The develop branch is now stable and ready for release consideration. Main remaining task is to complete Docker testing with Claude Code before proceeding with release.
