# CI File Deletion Fix - PR #86 Summary

## Overview
PR #86 successfully fixed the critical CI file deletion issue where test files (especially tsconfig.test.json) were being deleted during test runs.

## Root Cause
- BackupManager and UpdateManager were using `process.cwd()` directly
- Tests instantiating these classes operated on the actual project directory
- File operations (especially restoreBackup) would move/delete real project files

## Solution Implemented
1. **Made rootDir configurable** in BackupManager and UpdateManager constructors
2. **Added comprehensive safety checks**:
   - Path validation (must be absolute)
   - Path traversal prevention
   - Production directory detection
   - Safe directory recognition
3. **Updated all tests** to use temporary directories
4. **Added security hardening** based on PR review

## Code Changes

### BackupManager.ts
```typescript
constructor(rootDir?: string) {
  // Validate rootDir parameter if provided
  if (rootDir) {
    // Prevent path traversal attacks first
    if (rootDir.includes('../') || rootDir.includes('..\\')) {
      throw new Error('rootDir cannot contain path traversal sequences');
    }
    // Then check if it's absolute
    if (!path.isAbsolute(rootDir)) {
      throw new Error('rootDir must be an absolute path');
    }
  }
  
  // Allow override for testing, default to process.cwd()
  this.rootDir = rootDir || process.cwd();
  
  // Safety check: Don't allow operations on directories containing critical files
  if (this.hasProductionFiles() && !this.isSafeTestDirectory()) {
    throw new Error('BackupManager cannot operate on production directory...');
  }
}
```

### Test Updates
All test files now use safe temporary directories:
```typescript
const testDir = path.join(os.tmpdir(), 'dollhouse-test-backup', Date.now().toString());
backupManager = new BackupManager(testDir);
```

## Results
- ✅ All 221 tests passing locally
- ✅ tsconfig.test.json no longer deleted during test runs
- ✅ Comprehensive security improvements
- ✅ Works for any project (not hardcoded to DollhouseMCP)

## Related Issues
- Issue #79: Ubuntu CI ENOENT errors (resolved)
- Issue #83: tsconfig.test.json not found (resolved)
- Issue #87: Future enhancements from PR review
- Issue #88: Remaining CI failures (unrelated to file deletion)

## Key Learnings
1. Always consider test environment isolation
2. File operations in tests need explicit safety boundaries
3. Defense in depth - multiple validation layers
4. Clear error messages guide proper usage
