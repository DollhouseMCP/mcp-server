### 3. ✅ Retained Native ARM64 Runners
The native ARM64 runners proved successful and remain in the Docker workflow for better performance.

## Agent Orchestration Best Practices

Based on the successful PR #606 implementation, here are the recommended best practices for future agent-driven development:

### 1. Agent Naming & Purpose
**✅ DO**: Use descriptive, purpose-specific names
```
- "Search Index Optimizer Agent"
- "Security Validation Specialist"
- "Performance Testing Agent"
```

**❌ DON'T**: Use generic names
```
- "Agent 1"
- "Helper Agent"
- "Task Worker"
```

### 2. Coordinating Document Pattern
Create a central coordination document that all agents can read and update:

```markdown
# Agent Coordination Document - [Feature Name]

## Overall Status
- Total Progress: 60%
- Blockers: None
- Last Updated: [timestamp]

## Agent Tasks
| Agent | Task | Status | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| Search Optimizer | Implement caching | ✅ Complete | LRU cache with 50MB limit |
| Security Validator | Review code | 🔄 In Progress | Found 2 issues |
| Performance Tester | Run benchmarks | ⏳ Waiting | Needs optimizer to finish |

## Shared Context
- Key decisions made...
- Important findings...
- Dependencies identified...
```

### 3. Agent Handoff Strategy
When an agent runs out of context, ensure smooth handoff:

1. **Agent completes work** → Updates coordination document
2. **New agent spawned** → Reads coordination document first
3. **Continues from checkpoint** → Updates status immediately

### 4. Parallel vs Sequential Execution

**Parallel Execution** (when tasks are independent):
```python
agents = [
    spawn_agent("UI Implementation", ui_task),
    spawn_agent("API Development", api_task),
    spawn_agent("Test Creation", test_task)
]
await_all(agents)
```

**Sequential Execution** (when tasks have dependencies):
```python
search_agent = spawn_agent("Implement Search", search_task)
await search_agent.complete()

test_agent = spawn_agent("Test Search", test_task)
await test_agent.complete()
```

### 5. Agent Types & Specialization

#### Implementation Agents (Sonnet)
- Code writing
- Feature implementation
- Bug fixes
- Test creation

#### Orchestration Agents (Opus)
- Task planning
- Agent coordination
- Architecture decisions
- Progress monitoring

#### Validation Agents (Sonnet)
- Code review
- Security scanning
- Performance testing
- Quality assurance

### 6. Success Metrics from PR #606

**What Worked Well**:
- 9 agents deployed successfully
- 7x faster than sequential implementation
- Average rating: 4.76/5
- 100% task completion rate
- Agents saved as reusable elements

**Key Success Factors**:
1. Clear task definition for each agent
2. Coordinating document kept all agents aligned
3. Descriptive agent names made tracking easy
4. Parallel execution where possible
5. Validation agents caught issues early

## Recommended Agent Workflow

### Step 1: Planning with Opus
```markdown
1. Opus analyzes the requirements
2. Creates task breakdown
3. Identifies dependencies
4. Creates coordination document
5. Determines agent allocation
```

### Step 2: Implementation with Sonnet Agents
```markdown
1. Spawn specialized agents for each task
2. Agents read coordination document
3. Agents implement their specific tasks
4. Agents update coordination document
5. Agents mark tasks complete
```

### Step 3: Validation with Specialized Agents
```markdown
1. Code review agent checks implementation
2. Security agent scans for vulnerabilities
3. Performance agent runs benchmarks
4. Test agent verifies functionality
```

### Step 4: Integration with Opus
```markdown
1. Opus reviews all agent outputs
2. Coordinates fixes if issues found
3. Ensures all requirements met
4. Prepares final deliverable
```

## Agent Communication Patterns

### 1. Status Updates
Agents should update the coordination document with:
- Current progress percentage
- Blockers encountered
- Decisions made
- Next steps

### 2. Error Handling
When an agent encounters an error:
1. Document the error in coordination doc
2. Mark task as blocked
3. Opus spawns specialist agent to resolve
4. Original agent continues after resolution

### 3. Knowledge Transfer
Each agent should document:
- What they learned
- Patterns identified
- Reusable code created
- Recommendations for future

## Performance Optimization Tips

### 1. Agent Resource Allocation
- **Heavy Tasks**: Allocate more context/time
- **Light Tasks**: Use quick, focused agents
- **Validation**: Can run in parallel

### 2. Context Management
- Keep coordination doc under 2000 tokens
- Use references to files instead of inline code
- Summarize completed work, don't repeat it

### 3. Parallel Execution Guidelines
**Can Run in Parallel**:
- Independent features
- Different file modifications
- Test creation
- Documentation

**Must Run Sequential**:
- Dependent features
- Same file modifications
- Integration tasks
- Final validation

## Reusable Agent Templates

Based on PR #606 success, here are templates for common agents:

### Feature Implementation Agent
```markdown
Role: Implement [specific feature]
Context: Read coordination doc first
Tasks:
1. Review existing code
2. Implement feature
3. Add tests
4. Update coordination doc
Success Criteria: Tests pass, no lint errors
```

### Code Review Agent
```markdown
Role: Review [PR/feature] for issues
Context: Security and performance focus
Tasks:
1. Check for vulnerabilities
2. Verify best practices
3. Assess performance impact
4. Document findings
Success Criteria: No critical issues
```

### Performance Optimization Agent
```markdown
Role: Optimize [component] performance
Context: Current metrics in coordination doc
Tasks:
1. Profile current performance
2. Identify bottlenecks
3. Implement optimizations
4. Measure improvements
Success Criteria: Meet performance targets
```

## Lessons Learned from PR #606

### What Made It Successful
1. **Clear Architecture First**: Three-tier index design established upfront
2. **Specialized Agents**: Each agent had specific expertise
3. **Metrics-Driven**: Clear performance targets defined
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: 1,300 lines of tests added
5. **Documentation**: Every decision documented

### Areas for Improvement
1. **GitHub API Performance**: Need pre-warming strategy
2. **Collection Offline Mode**: Limited offline capability
3. **Parameter Validation**: Minor inconsistencies

## Next Session Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Implement GitHub API pre-warming for better performance

## Summary

The successful merge of PR #606 demonstrates the power of well-orchestrated agent development. By following these best practices:

1. **Use descriptive agent names** - Know what each agent does
2. **Maintain coordination document** - Keep all agents aligned
3. **Opus orchestrates, Sonnet implements** - Use the right model for each task
4. **Parallel where possible** - Maximize efficiency
5. **Document everything** - Enable smooth handoffs

The addition of permanent build info endpoints ensures we can always query build metadata without temporary CI scripts, making the system more maintainable and robust.
