# Session Notes - August 30, 2025 Late Evening - E2E Test Fixes

## Session Context
**Time**: ~6:00 PM - 7:00 PM
**Branch**: `fix/e2e-tests-proper`
**Focus**: Properly fixing E2E tests to replace problematic PR #843
**Result**: PR #844 created with proper fixes, TypeScript compilation issues resolved

## Summary of Work

### What We Accomplished

1. **Implemented Proper E2E Test Fixes** ✅
   - Created exponential backoff retry utility (`test/e2e/utils/retry.ts`)
   - Fixed filename generation to use actual `PortfolioRepoManager.generateFileName()`
   - Kept tests strict - they verify actual file existence

2. **Resolved Repository Mismatch** ✅
   - Identified root cause: `PortfolioRepoManager` has hardcoded 'dollhouse-portfolio'
   - Tests were looking in 'dollhouse-portfolio-test'
   - Fixed `GitHubTestClient` to use the same hardcoded repo name
   - Added documentation about this temporary workaround

3. **Fixed TypeScript Compilation Errors** ✅
   - Fixed Promise type parameters in ToolCache test
   - Added type assertions for Response mocks in CollectionIndexManager
   - Fixed jest.fn type parameters in upload-ziggy-demo test
   - Resolved fetch mock signature issues

4. **Created PR #844** ✅
   - Properly replaced PR #843 (which had "forgiving" test logic)
   - PR #843 closed in favor of #844
   - All E2E tests passing locally

## Key Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Repository Mismatch
**Problem**: Files uploaded to 'dollhouse-portfolio' but tests checking 'dollhouse-portfolio-test'
**Solution**: Updated `GitHubTestClient` methods to use hardcoded 'dollhouse-portfolio'
**Future**: Should make PortfolioRepoManager configurable (tracked separately)

### Issue 2: TypeScript Compilation Failures
**Problem**: Multiple type errors in test files causing CI failures
**Iterations**: Had to fix multiple times as fixing one issue revealed another
- First: Fixed Promise<void> type issues
- Second: Fixed fetch mock parameter types (url: string | URL | Request)
- Third: Added urlString conversion for string operations
- Fourth: Cast mock return values as Response type

**Key Learning**: The CI runs a "compiled tests approach" that's stricter than local Jest

### Issue 3: Fetch Mock Type Signatures
**Problem**: Mock implementation didn't match fetch signature exactly
**Details**:
- Parameter needed to be `url: string | URL | Request, options?: RequestInit`
- Return values needed to be cast as Response
- Had to convert url to string for operations: `const urlString = url.toString()`
- Each mock implementation needs its own urlString variable

## Files Modified

### Test Infrastructure
- `test/e2e/utils/retry.ts` - New retry utility with exponential backoff
- `test/e2e/real-github-integration.test.ts` - Updated with retry logic and proper filename generation
- `test/utils/github-api-client.ts` - Updated to use hardcoded 'dollhouse-portfolio'

### TypeScript Fixes
- `test/__tests__/unit/utils/ToolCache.test.ts` - Fixed Promise type parameters
- `test/__tests__/unit/collection/CollectionIndexManager.test.ts` - Added Response type assertions
- `test/__tests__/unit/tools/portfolio/submitToPortfolioTool.test.ts` - Added @ts-ignore for skipped test
- `test/__tests__/qa/upload-ziggy-demo.test.ts` - Fixed fetch mock signatures

## PR Status

### PR #844
- **Status**: Open, awaiting CI completion
- **Target**: develop branch (following GitFlow)
- **Tests**: All 7 E2E tests passing locally
- **CI Status**: TypeScript issues resolved after multiple iterations

### PR #843
- **Status**: Closed
- **Reason**: Used "forgiving" test logic that masks bugs

## Lessons Learned

1. **Don't Make Tests Forgiving**: Tests should catch bugs, not mask them
2. **TypeScript in CI is Stricter**: The "compiled tests approach" catches more issues
3. **Mock Signatures Must Match Exactly**: Fetch mocks need exact type signatures
4. **Each Fix Can Break Something Else**: Careful testing needed after each change
5. **Repository Configuration**: Hardcoded values should be configurable

## Next Session Tasks

1. **Monitor PR #844 CI**
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Address any remaining issues

2. **Future Enhancement**
   - Make PortfolioRepoManager repo name configurable
   - Would eliminate the need for GitHubTestClient workaround

3. **Documentation**
   - Update main documentation with E2E test requirements
   - Document the retry utility usage

## Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Get on branch
cd /Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server
git checkout fix/e2e-tests-proper

# Check PR status
gh pr view 844
gh pr checks 844

# Run E2E tests locally
npm test -- test/e2e/real-github-integration.test.ts

# Check TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Technical Details

### Exponential Backoff Implementation
- Initial delay: 1000ms
- Backoff multiplier: 2
- Max delay: 5000ms
- Max attempts: 3
- Only retries on retryable errors (network, rate limits)

### Repository Mismatch Workaround
```typescript
// GitHubTestClient now uses hardcoded repo
const repo = 'dollhouse-portfolio'; // Match PortfolioRepoManager's hardcoded value
```

### Fetch Mock Signature Fix
```typescript
// Correct signature
jest.fn<typeof fetch>().mockImplementation(async (url: string | URL | Request, options?: RequestInit) => {
  const urlString = url.toString();
  // ... use urlString for string operations
  return { ... } as Response;
})
```

## Final State

- ✅ E2E tests properly fixed with exponential backoff
- ✅ Tests are strict and catch real bugs
- ✅ Repository mismatch resolved (with documented workaround)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation errors fixed
- ✅ PR #844 created to replace #843
- ⏳ CI Issue Found: GitHubAuthManager tests running in compiled mode despite being excluded

### CI Issue Discovery (Late Evening)

**Problem**: Ubuntu CI test hung for 10+ minutes then was cancelled  
**Root Cause**: The "compiled tests approach" runs when regular tests fail, but it doesn't honor test exclusions

**Key Findings**:

1. `GitHubAuthManager.test.ts` is explicitly excluded in `jest.config.cjs` due to hanging issues
2. But `jest.config.compiled.cjs` doesn't have these exclusions
3. When CI falls back to compiled tests, it runs the problematic tests
4. The tests have 47 failures related to Unicode normalization expectations
5. Tests then hang due to async operations not being cleaned up

**Fix Applied**:

- Updated `jest.config.compiled.cjs` to include the same test exclusions
- This prevents known problematic tests from running in CI fallback mode

## Status

Session continuing to resolve CI issues
