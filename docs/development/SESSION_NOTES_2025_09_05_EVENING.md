# Session Notes - September 5, 2025 (Evening)

**Date**: September 5, 2025  
**Time**: 4:00 PM - 7:30 PM ET  
**Participants**: Mick, Alex Sterling (AI Assistant)  
**Context**: Repository maintenance, workflow fixes, DollhouseMCP elements activation  

## Session Summary

Productive evening session focused on repository cleanup, fixing automation loops, and activating DollhouseMCP elements. Successfully resolved multiple GitHub workflow issues across AILIS repository and performed comprehensive branch cleanup.

## Work Completed

### 1. Developer Kit Repository
- ✅ Merged PR #1: RAPPEL Framework Comparison documentation
  - Added comprehensive documentation comparing DollhouseMCP with Chris Penn's RAPPEL framework
  - Documented 378+ MCP-compatible platforms
  - Positioned DollhouseMCP as key player in AI customization ecosystem

- ✅ Created Issue #6: RAPPEL Framework Implementation Guide
  - Planning document for creating practical RAPPEL → DollhouseMCP guidance
  - Includes evaluation, implementation guide, templates, and workflows

### 2. AILIS Repository - Critical Fixes

#### YAML Multiline String Fix
- ✅ Created and merged PR #18: Hotfix for YAML parsing errors
  - Fixed workflow failures caused by YAML interpreting markdown lists in multiline strings
  - Changed template literals to array.join() format
  - Added comprehensive validation infrastructure:
    - `.github/scripts/validate-workflows.py`
    - `.github/workflows/yaml-validation.yml`
    - `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
    - Updated CONTRIBUTING.md with YAML best practices

#### Changelog Automation Loop Fix
- ✅ Identified self-referential loop in changelog automation
  - Workflow was triggering itself when CHANGELOG.md was merged
  - Created PR #21: Added `paths-ignore: - 'CHANGELOG.md'` to prevent loop
  - Successfully merged with admin override

#### Branch Cleanup
- ✅ Deleted 9 stale branches:
  - 6 changelog-update-* branches
  - 3 hotfix branches (link-validation, readme-workflow-protection, workflow-failures)
- ✅ Committed session notes updates

### 3. Repository Status Survey

Surveyed all DollhouseMCP repositories for pending work:

**Repositories with actionable items:**
- **mcp-server**: 21 commits ahead on hotfix/workflow-failures branch
- **tools-internal**: Untracked `.github/GITFLOW.md` file
- **experimental**: 2 untracked files
- **collection**: Open dependency update PR

### 4. DollhouseMCP Elements Activation

#### Activated Personas
- ✅ **Alex Sterling**: Thorough and capable Claude Code assistant
  - Detail-oriented, quality-focused approach
  - Full utilization of Claude Code tools

#### Activated Skills
- ✅ **Conversation Audio Summarizer**: macOS TTS integration for summaries
  - Updated with comprehensive pronunciation guide
  - Added "YAML" → "yammel" pronunciation
  - Integrated master pronunciation guide from business repository

### 5. Audio Pronunciation Guide Discovery
- ✅ Located master pronunciation guide: `business/documents/identity/audio-pronunciation-guide.md`
- ✅ Updated conversation-audio-summarizer skill with pronunciation rules
- ✅ Demonstrated audio summaries to Erik and Heather

### 6. YouTube Channel Concept
- ✅ Developed "Stupid AI Tricks with DollhouseMCP" concept
  - Letterman-style demonstrations of DollhouseMCP features
  - Created audio pitch/summary of channel concept
  - Episode ideas: Gordon Ramsay code reviews, tough-love coach, pronunciation disasters

## Key Decisions Made

1. **YAML Workflow Fix Strategy**: Used array.join() pattern instead of template literals
2. **Changelog Automation**: Added path exclusion to prevent self-triggering
3. **Branch Management**: Cleaned up stale branches to maintain repository hygiene
4. **Audio Pronunciation**: Standardized on "yammel" for YAML across all audio outputs
5. **YouTube Channel**: Approved "Stupid AI Tricks" format for DollhouseMCP demos

## Blockers Resolved

- ✅ YAML parsing errors in GitHub workflows
- ✅ Changelog automation infinite loop
- ✅ Repository divergence from stale branches

## For Tomorrow

### Priority Tasks
1. **mcp-server**: Address 21 commits on hotfix/workflow-failures branch
   - Review what's in those commits
   - Determine if ready to merge or needs cleanup

2. **tools-internal**: Handle untracked GitFlow file
   - Review and potentially commit `.github/GITFLOW.md`

3. **Repository Cleanup**: Continue systematic review
   - Check experimental repository's 2 untracked files
   - Review open PRs across all repositories

### Open Questions
- Should we standardize GitFlow workflows across all repositories?
- NPM token issue from earlier sessions - still blocked?
- Auto-tagging workflow - needs implementation?

## Technical Notes

### YAML Fix Pattern
```yaml
# Before (causes parsing errors):
body: `- List item`

# After (works correctly):
body: [
  '* List item'
].join('\n')
```

### Audio Pronunciation Rules Established
- YAML → "yammel"
- AI → "A I" (separate letters)
- MCP → "M C P" (separate letters)
- npm → "N P M" (separate letters)

## Environment Status
- Working Directory: `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active`
- Active Personas: Alex Sterling
- Active Skills: Conversation Audio Summarizer
- Model: Opus 4.1 (switching between Opus and Sonnet based on usage)

## Session Metrics
- PRs Merged: 3 (#1, #18, #21)
- Issues Created: 1 (#6)
- Branches Deleted: 9
- Repositories Updated: 3 (developer-kit, AILIS, mcp-server session notes)
