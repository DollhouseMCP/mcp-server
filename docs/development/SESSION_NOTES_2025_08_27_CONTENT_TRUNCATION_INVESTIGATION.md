# Session Notes - August 27, 2025 - Content Truncation Investigation

**Time**: Morning/Afternoon session  
**Branch**: `feature/content-truncation-investigation`  
**Context**: Investigating critical content truncation issue where personas are cut off mid-sentence  
**Issues**: #784 (Content Truncation), #785 (Collection Error Codes)  

## Session Summary

Successfully identified that content truncation is happening during **persona creation**, not during GitHub upload as initially thought. User confirmed this by creating a persona and checking the markdown file directly - it was already truncated in the local file.

## Critical Discovery (End of Session)

**USER FINDING**: "I just tested creating a persona and then check the markdown document and it stops halfway through a sentence"

This means the truncation happens during:
1. **Persona creation via chat interface** (create_persona tool)
2. **Initial file save** to local markdown
3. **BEFORE any GitHub upload**

## Investigation Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Setup
- Created GitHub Issues #784 (truncation) and #785 (error codes)
- Added diagnostic logging to PersonaLoader and PortfolioRepoManager
- Created comprehensive test suite for content integrity

### Phase 2: Local Testing
- Tested content sizes from 1KB to 500KB
- **Result**: NO truncation in local save/load operations
- All test content preserved end markers correctly

### Phase 3: Production Testing
- Set up production MCP v1.6.9 in separate Claude Code session
- Created test personas - NO truncation
- Confirmed Business Consultant persona displays complete content

### Phase 4: GitHub Investigation
- Found ARIA-7 in GitHub portfolio
- Downloaded and confirmed truncated at exactly **1770 bytes**
- Content ends mid-sentence: "you often wonder a"
- J.A.R.V.I.S (1791 bytes) is NOT truncated

### Phase 5: Root Cause Discovery
- Initially thought truncation happened during GitHub upload
- User's test proved truncation happens **during persona creation**
- The markdown file is already truncated when saved locally

## Key Findings

1. **Truncation Point**: Exactly 1770 bytes for ARIA-7
2. **When**: During persona creation, NOT GitHub upload
3. **Where**: In the create_persona tool or PersonaLoader.savePersona()
4. **Pattern**: Not all personas affected (J.A.R.V.I.S is complete at 1791 bytes)

## Code Areas to Investigate Next Session

### Priority 1: Create Persona Tool
```typescript
// src/index.ts - createPersona()
// Check for any substring or length limits
// Look for truncation during content processing
```

### Priority 2: PersonaLoader Save
```typescript
// src/persona/PersonaLoader.ts - savePersona()
// Check SecureYamlParser.stringify()
// Check FileLockManager.atomicWriteFile()
```

### Priority 3: Security Validators
```typescript
// src/security/InputValidator.ts
// Check MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH or other limits
// src/security/secureYamlParser.ts
// Check for any content size restrictions
```

## Diagnostic Logging Added

Added `[CONTENT-TRACE]` logging at:
- PersonaLoader.loadPersona() - file size tracking
- PersonaLoader.savePersona() - content size before/after save
- PortfolioRepoManager.saveElement() - GitHub upload tracking

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `/test/__tests__/qa/content-truncation.test.ts` - Content integrity tests
- `/docs/development/PLAN_CONTENT_TRUNCATION_AND_COLLECTION.md` - Investigation plan
- `/docs/development/SESSION_NOTES_2025_08_27_CONTENT_TRUNCATION_INVESTIGATION.md` - This file

### Modified Files
- `/src/persona/PersonaLoader.ts` - Added diagnostic logging
- `/src/portfolio/PortfolioRepoManager.ts` - Added content trace logging

## Test Results

### Local Save/Load Tests ✅
- 1KB: PASS - End marker preserved
- 10KB: PASS - End marker preserved  
- 50KB: PASS - End marker preserved
- 100KB: PASS - End marker preserved
- 500KB: PASS - End marker preserved

### PersonaElement Serialization ✅
- 130KB content: PASS - Full content preserved

## Next Session Priority Actions

1. **Check create_persona tool** for any content limits
2. **Test creating large personas** via chat interface
3. **Add logging to creation process** to find exact truncation point
4. **Check for 1770-byte limit** in security validators
5. **Test with various content sizes** through chat creation

## Hypothesis for Next Session

The truncation likely happens in one of:
1. **Input validation** during create_persona
2. **Security sanitization** that limits content
3. **YAML serialization** with a size limit
4. **A hardcoded limit** around 1700-1800 characters

## Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Get back on branch
cd /Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server
git checkout feature/content-truncation-investigation
git pull

# Search for potential limits
grep -r "1700\|1800\|1770" src/
grep -r "MAX.*LENGTH\|MAX.*SIZE" src/ | grep -v test

# Run tests
npm test -- test/__tests__/qa/content-truncation.test.ts
```

## Setup Instructions Used for Testing

Successfully set up production MCP in Claude Code:
```bash
npm install -g @dollhousemcp/mcp-server@latest
claude mcp add dollhousemcp-test npx @dollhousemcp/mcp-server
```

## Branch Status

- Branch pushed to GitHub
- Ready for PR once issue is fixed
- All diagnostic logging in place
- Test infrastructure ready

## Critical Note for Next Session

**THE TRUNCATION HAPPENS DURING PERSONA CREATION, NOT GITHUB UPLOAD**

This completely changes where to look. Focus on:
- The create_persona tool implementation
- Input validation/sanitization
- Any limits in the chat interface processing
