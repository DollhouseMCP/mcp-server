# Session Notes - September 7, 2025 - Evening Repository Cleanup

## Session Context
**Time**: Evening session (~5:30 PM)
**Starting Issue**: Two failing CI checks on main branch (README sync and performance testing)
**Branch**: Created `fix/ci-workflow-failures` for fixes
**PR Created**: #886 to develop branch

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed README Sync Workflow ✅
**Problem**: Workflow was attempting to push directly to protected main branch
**Root Cause**: Workflow triggered on both main and develop branches
**Solution**: Modified workflow to only trigger on develop branch

**Key Insight**: Following GitFlow properly means README changes flow:
- Feature branches → develop (direct push allowed)
- Develop → main (via release branches, no direct push needed)

**Changes**:
- Modified `.github/workflows/readme-sync.yml` line 33
- Removed `main` from branch triggers
- Added explanatory comment about GitFlow integration

### 2. Fixed Performance Testing Workflow ✅
**Problem**: Windows CI failing but error was being swallowed
**Root Cause**: Test command failures hidden by output redirection
**Solution**: Added proper error handling and output

**Changes**:
- Modified `.github/workflows/performance-testing.yml` lines 181, 187
- Added exit code capture: `|| TEST_EXIT_CODE=$?`
- Added failure detection and log output (lines 192-197)
- Tests failures will now be visible in CI logs

### 3. Activated DollhouseMCP Elements ✅
**Persona Activated**: session-notes-writer v1.4
- Specialized documentation agent
- Helps create comprehensive session notes
- Tracks context and decisions made

## GitFlow Guardian Success Story

The GitFlow Guardian hooks worked perfectly:
1. Prevented direct commit to develop branch
2. Guided creation of proper feature branch
3. Validated PR creation to correct base branch

This demonstrates the value of the automated workflow enforcement.

## Technical Details

### README Sync Design Understanding
After reviewing the documentation from August 31st sessions:
- Modular README system with chunks in `docs/readme/chunks/`
- Build process creates README.npm.md and README.github.md
- Workflow automates rebuilding when chunks change
- System designed to eliminate version number inconsistencies

### Key Decision: Develop-Only Workflow
**Why not create PRs from main?**
- Would require hotfix branches (increments version unnecessarily)
- Violates GitFlow principles
- README changes should flow through normal release process
- Main should only receive changes via proper merges

## PR #886 Status

Created pull request to develop branch:
- Title: "fix: Fix CI workflow issues for README sync and performance testing"
- URL: https://github.com/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server/pull/886
- Changes: 2 workflow files modified
- Impact: Fixes both failing CI checks on main branch

## Session Statistics

- **Branches Created**: 1 (`fix/ci-workflow-failures`)
- **Files Modified**: 2 workflow files
- **Lines Changed**: ~16 lines (12 additions, 4 deletions)
- **PR Created**: #886
- **Tests Fixed**: 2 CI workflows
- **Time Saved**: Future CI runs won't fail on these issues

## Lessons Learned

1. **README Sync Strategy**: Only sync on develop, let GitFlow handle main
2. **Error Visibility**: Always capture and display test failures in CI
3. **GitFlow Guardian**: Works effectively to prevent workflow violations
4. **Documentation Review**: Important to understand existing systems before modifying

## Next Session Recommendations

### If PR #886 is Merged
1. Verify CI checks pass on develop
2. Consider creating release branch if ready for v1.7.3
3. Monitor main branch CI after next release merge

### Repository Cleanup Tasks
- Review other CI workflows for similar issues
- Check if any other workflows trigger on main unnecessarily
- Consider documenting the README sync workflow in more detail

### DollhouseMCP Elements
No special personas needed for next session unless:
- Doing development work: Activate alex-sterling or similar
- Writing documentation: Use session-notes-writer
- Debugging issues: Consider debug-detective

## Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Check PR status
gh pr view 886

# If merged, update develop
git checkout develop
git pull

# Check CI status
gh run list --branch develop --limit 5
```
