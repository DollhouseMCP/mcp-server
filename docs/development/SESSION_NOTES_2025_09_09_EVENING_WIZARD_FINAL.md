# Session Notes - September 9, 2025 Evening - Wizard Improvements Final

## Session Overview
**Time**: ~6:45 PM - 7:35 PM  
**Context**: Final evening session on wizard improvements  
**Branch**: `feature/wizard-handler-improvements`  
**Result**: âœ… PR #907 merged, follow-up issues created, display challenges identified

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. PR #907 Review Response & Merge âœ…
Successfully addressed all review feedback and merged PR #907 with comprehensive improvements:

#### Implemented Suggestions
- **Test Coverage**: Created 11 comprehensive tests in ConfigHandler.test.ts
- **Template System**: Built wizardTemplates.ts for future i18n support
- **JSDoc Documentation**: Added async method documentation
- **Friendly Null Values**: Replaced technical "null" with user-friendly messages

#### Review Highlights
- Received 5-star ratings across all categories
- Reviewer praised UX improvements and code quality
- Minor technical debt items identified for follow-up

### 2. Created Follow-Up Issues âœ…
Created 5 GitHub issues (#908-#912) to track technical debt:
- **#908**: Complete WizardTemplateBuilder implementation
- **#909**: Full template migration and remove legacy code
- **#910**: Add integration tests for template system
- **#911**: Replace JSON.parse/stringify with structuredClone (Node 24 ready!)
- **#912**: Add tests to ensure wizard defaults stay in sync

### 3. Display Verbatim Challenge ðŸ”„

#### The Core Problem
MCP responses are interpreted by LLMs before display, causing our carefully crafted welcome message to be paraphrased rather than shown verbatim.

#### Strategies Attempted
1. **Code Block Wrapping** - Most LLMs display code blocks verbatim
2. **Display Instructions** - Explicitly asking for verbatim display
3. **System Notice Format** - Box drawing characters for official look
4. **Blockquote Format** - Markdown blockquotes
5. **HTML Pre Tags** - HTML formatting preservation
6. **JSON Structure** - Structured data format

#### Implementation
Created `ConfigWizardDisplay.ts` with multiple display strategies:
- Environment variable `DOLLHOUSE_WIZARD_DISPLAY` to choose strategy
- Default: codeblock (works best with Claude)
- Options: instructions, system, blockquote, combined, html, json

### 4. Wizard Philosophy Clarification ðŸ’¡

**Key Insight from Mick**: The wizard should appear on ANY first tool interaction, including "harmless" ones like version checks.

**Rationale**:
- Version checks are non-threatening entry points for new users
- Users uncomfortable with unknown tools can start with info requests
- Wizard can be dismissed immediately if not wanted
- Only appears once (tracked in config)

**Mistake & Correction**:
- Initially added skip list for certain tools (get_build_info, etc.)
- Mick corrected: These are perfect entry points, not annoyances
- Reverted change to restore wizard on all first interactions

### 5. Configuration Updates âœ…
Added `dollhousemcp-wizard` configuration to Claude Desktop:
```json
"dollhousemcp-wizard": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
  "env": {
    "MCP_SERVER_VERSION": "1.7.3-wizard-improvements",
    "DOLLHOUSE_VERBOSE_LOGGING": "true",
    "DOLLHOUSE_LOG_TIMING": "true",
    "DOLLHOUSE_BRANCH": "feature/wizard-handler-improvements",
    "DOLLHOUSE_PORTFOLIO_DIR": "/Users/mick/.dollhouse/wizard-test",
    "DOLLHOUSE_WIZARD_DISPLAY": "instructions"
  }
}
```

## Technical Insights

### MCP Limitation Discovered
**No standard "display verbatim" directive in MCP specification**
- Each LLM (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) interprets responses differently
- No way to bypass interpretation layer
- Content always goes through LLM's summarization/paraphrasing

### Logging Clarification
- Verbose logging goes to stderr (not conversation)
- Captured in Claude Desktop's internal logs
- Doesn't affect display issues

### Node Version Discovery
- Running Node 24.1.0 (not 22 as initially thought)
- `structuredClone` is available now (added in Node 17)
- Can immediately use instead of JSON.parse/stringify

## Design Decisions

### Template System Architecture
- Created infrastructure but didn't fully implement (intentional)
- Avoids too many changes in one PR
- Stub implementation ready for completion (#908)
- Phased migration plan proposed

### Display Strategy Approach
- Multiple strategies for different LLMs
- Configurable via environment variable
- Defaults to code block (most universal)
- Can experiment with different approaches

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Always Ask Before Major Changes
- Changed wizard to skip certain tools without asking
- Mick had intentional design reasons for current behavior
- Reverted immediately when corrected

### 2. User Journey Understanding
- Non-technical users need gentle entry points
- "Harmless" tools like version checks are perfect first interactions
- Reduce friction and fear for new users

### 3. MCP Specification Gap
- Verbatim display is a common need
- No standard solution across LLM platforms
- Worth raising with MCP specification maintainers

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate
1. Test different display strategies with various LLMs
2. Complete WizardTemplateBuilder implementation (#908)
3. Research MCP specification for display directives

### Future
1. Full template migration (#909)
2. Integration tests (#910)
3. Performance improvements with structuredClone (#911)

## Quote from Session

> "I intentionally wanted it to be attached to all dollhouse tools, even something like version info, because sometimes people are uncomfortable actually trying to get a tool to do something if they don't know what that will do. So simply asking about the build info... is a great entryway that is harmless to the end user and then walks them through a nice wizard."

This perfectly captures the user-centric design philosophy.

## Session Metrics
- **Duration**: ~50 minutes
- **PRs Merged**: 1 (#907)
- **Issues Created**: 5 (#908-#912)
- **Tests Added**: 11
- **Files Created**: 4 (templates, display, tests, etc.)
- **Commits**: 4

## End State
- PR #907 successfully merged with all improvements
- Wizard system enhanced but display challenge remains
- Clear follow-up work documented in issues
- Feature branch ready for additional experimentation

---

**Key Takeaway**: The wizard improvements are solid, but MCP's lack of verbatim display standard is a fundamental limitation that affects all MCP servers trying to present formatted content.
