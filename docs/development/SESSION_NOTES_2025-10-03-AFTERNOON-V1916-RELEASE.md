# Session Notes - October 3, 2025 (Afternoon)

**Date**: October 3, 2025
**Time**: 2:15 PM - 3:30 PM (75 minutes)
**Focus**: Release v1.9.16 to production
**Outcome**: ✅ Merged to main, ⚠️ NPM publish and GitHub Release pending

## Session Summary

Successfully completed the release process for v1.9.16 (Platform-agnostic MCP client documentation + SonarCloud fixes). Merged PR #1238 to main with all CI checks passing, synced back to develop, but encountered issues with NPM publishing to public registry. Need follow-up session to complete NPM publish and create GitHub Release.

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Release Preparation ✅
- Stashed experimental capability index resource work (not for this release)
- Updated README chunks with v1.9.16 release notes
- Bumped version to 1.9.16 in package.json and package-lock.json
- Created comprehensive release notes: `docs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.9.16.md`
- Build succeeded, tests passed (excluding pre-existing GitHubRateLimiter flaky tests)

### 2. Development Cleanup ✅
- Removed clutter files from root directory:
  - `pr_body_update.md`
  - `test-memory-edit.js`
  - `test-output.md`
  - `security-audit-report.md`

### 3. Release Branch & PR ✅
- Created `release/v1.9.16` branch from develop
- Created PR #1238: "Release v1.9.16 - Platform-agnostic MCP client documentation + SonarCloud fixes"
- Comprehensive PR description with full release details

### 4. Critical Test Fix ✅
**Problem**: GitHubRateLimiter tests failing with "Aborting after 100000 timers"
- GitHubRateLimiter sets up 5-minute `setInterval()` in constructor
- Tests used `jest.runAllTimers()` which tries to run infinite intervals
- Jest aborts after 100,000 timers

**Solution**: One-line fix
- Replaced all `jest.runAllTimers()` with `jest.runOnlyPendingTimers()` (9 occurrences)
- `runOnlyPendingTimers()` only runs currently scheduled timers without interval rescheduling
- Committed to release branch: `fix(test): Replace runAllTimers with runOnlyPendingTimers`

### 5. CI Validation ✅
All checks passed on PR #1238:
- ✅ Test (ubuntu, macos, windows, Node 20.x)
- ✅ Docker Build & Test (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- ✅ Docker Compose Test
- ✅ Security Audit
- ✅ SonarCloud Code Analysis (PASSING)
- ✅ CodeQL Analysis
- ✅ Claude Code Review
- ✅ Validate Build Artifacts

### 6. Merge to Main ✅
- PR #1238 merged to main successfully
- Release branch deleted
- Fast-forward merge (clean, no conflicts)

### 7. Tag Management ✅
- Original tag v1.9.16 was on develop commit `11f83629`
- Moved tag to main merge commit `b2a91000` (latest)
- Pushed updated tag to remote

### 8. Sync Back to Develop ✅
- Merged main back to develop
- Included GitHubRateLimiter test fix
- Pushed to origin/develop

## Release Content: v1.9.16

### 📚 Documentation (Main Focus)
**Platform-Agnostic MCP Client Documentation** (#1236, #1237)
- Added "MCP Client Compatibility" section explicitly stating stdio transport compatibility
- Listed Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Gemini, and other MCP clients as supported
- Updated all "Configure Claude Desktop" headers → "Configure Your MCP Client"

- New comprehensive guide: `docs/guides/MCP_CLIENT_SETUP.md` (551 lines)
- Updated troubleshooting to be platform-agnostic

**Workflow Documentation** (#1235)
- Added workflow examples for efficient issue handling
- Created `docs/development/workflow-examples/` directory

**Code Comments**
- `src/config/ConfigManager.ts:11` - OAuth comment updated
- `src/portfolio/PortfolioManager.ts:177` - Logging comment updated

### 🧹 Code Quality (19 SonarCloud Issues)
- **S7723**: Array constructor modernization (15 issues) - #1233
  - Replaced `new Array(length)` → `Array.from({ length })`
- **S7758**: String method modernization (4 fixed, 2 false positives) - #1234
- **Cleanup**: Removed temporary SonarCloud scripts (#1232)
  - mark-hotspots.sh, mark-crypto-hotspots.sh, etc.
  - Updated .gitignore patterns

### 📊 Impact
- ✅ Removes artificial barrier for Gemini and other MCP client users
- ✅ 19 SonarCloud issues resolved
- ✅ Maintains Claude Desktop as primary example while being inclusive

## Issues Encountered

### 1. NPM Publishing Status ⚠️
**GitHub Packages**: ✅ Published successfully
- Workflow "Publish to GitHub Packages" succeeded
- Published to `https://npm.pkg.github.com/@DollhouseMCP/mcp-server`
- Second run failed with expected error: `409 Conflict - Cannot publish over existing version`

**Public NPM Registry**: ⚠️ NOT YET PUBLISHED
- `npm view @dollhousemcp/mcp-server version` returns `1.9.15`
- v1.9.16 not yet available on public NPM
- No automated workflow found for public NPM publishing
- Likely requires manual `npm publish` or GitHub Release trigger

### 2. GitHub Release ⚠️
**Status**: NOT YET CREATED
- Tag v1.9.16 exists on main
- Latest release still shows v1.9.15
- Need to create GitHub Release from tag v1.9.16
- Release notes already prepared in `docs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.9.16.md`

---

## Next Session Priorities

### Critical: Complete Release Process
1. **Publish to Public NPM**
   - Option 1: Manual `npm publish` from main branch
   - Option 2: Trigger via GitHub Release creation
   - Verify version appears on https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dollhousemcp/mcp-server

2. **Create GitHub Release**
   - Create release from tag v1.9.16
   - Use content from `docs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.9.16.md`
   - Title: "Release v1.9.16 - Platform-agnostic MCP client documentation + SonarCloud fixes"
   - Check if this triggers NPM publish workflow

3. **Investigate Publishing Workflow**
   - Why isn't there an automated NPM publish workflow?
   - Only "Publish to GitHub Packages" workflow exists
   - Check if GitHub Releases should trigger NPM publish
   - Document the correct release process

### Optional: Resume Experimental Work
- Unstash capability index resource injection work
- Review and decide if it should go into next release

## Commands Reference

### Check NPM Version
```bash
npm view @dollhousemcp/mcp-server version
```

### Create GitHub Release
```bash
gh release create v1.9.16 \
  --title "Release v1.9.16 - Platform-agnostic MCP client documentation + SonarCloud fixes" \
  --notes-file docs/releases/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.9.16.md
```

### Manual NPM Publish (if needed)

## Key Learnings

### 1. GitHubRateLimiter Test Issue
- `jest.runAllTimers()` incompatible with `setInterval()` in code under test
- Always use `jest.runOnlyPendingTimers()` when testing code with intervals
- Simple one-line fix resolved Extended Node Compatibility failures

### 2. Release Process Gaps
- Automated publishing only covers GitHub Packages, not public NPM
- Need to document complete release process including NPM publish
- GitHub Release creation may trigger additional workflows

### 3. Tag Management
- Tags should point to merge commits on main, not pre-merge commits
- Moving tags requires: delete local, delete remote, recreate, push
