# Session Notes - September 22, 2025 (Afternoon) - v1.9.9 Release & Changelog Consolidation

## Session Summary
Completed v1.9.9 release process and implemented automated changelog generation from single source of truth.

## Completed Work

### v1.9.9 Release Process
1. **Created Release Branch** (PR #1074)
   - Created `release/v1.9.9` branch from develop
   - All CI checks passed successfully
   - Merged to main

2. **Tagged Release**
   - Created git tag v1.9.9
   - Pushed to origin
   - Created GitHub release with full notes

3. **Security Badge Hotfix** (PR #1075)
   - Fixed README security badge pointing to `docs/SECURITY.md`
   - Should point to `SECURITY.md` at repository root
   - Created hotfix branch, merged to main, backported to develop

4. **CodeQL Alerts**
   - Verified all 4 prototype pollution alerts closed after merge
   - Suppressions in `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml` working correctly

### Changelog Consolidation

#### Problem Identified
- Two separate changelog sources causing duplication:
  - `CHANGELOG.md` - Complete history back to v1.0.0 (July 1st)
  - `docs/readme/chunks/11-changelog-full.md` - Curated subset for README (v1.6.0+)
- Manual updates required in both places
- Easy to forget one, causing inconsistencies

#### Solution Implemented
1. **Created `scripts/generate-version-history.js`**
   - Reads CHANGELOG.md as source of truth
   - Generates README version history chunk automatically
   - Configurable to include only recent versions (v1.6.0+)
   - Converts CHANGELOG format to README-friendly format with emojis

2. **Updated Build Process**
   - Modified `scripts/build-readme.js` to call version history generator first
   - Ensures README always has latest changelog data
   - Single source of truth: CHANGELOG.md

3. **Added NPM Script**
   - `npm run generate:version-history` - standalone generation
   - Automatically called during `npm run build:readme`

### Changelog Update
- Added missing v1.9.9 entry to CHANGELOG.md (PR #1076)
- Synchronized with README version history

## Key Decisions

### Changelog as Source of Truth
- CHANGELOG.md contains ALL changes (100% complete history)
- README version history is curated subset (recent/important releases)
- Makes sense: full history for developers, highlights for users

### Automation Benefits
- Single place to update (CHANGELOG.md)
- README automatically gets updates
- No more manual synchronization
- Reduces chance of inconsistencies

## Files Changed

### Created
- `/scripts/generate-version-history.js` - Automated version history generator

### Modified
- `/scripts/build-readme.js` - Added version history generation step
- `/package.json` - Added generate:version-history script
- `/CHANGELOG.md` - Added v1.9.9 entry
- `/docs/readme/chunks/00-header-extended.md` - Fixed security badge link
- `/docs/readme/chunks/11-changelog-full.md` - Now auto-generated

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- [ ] Merge PR #1076 (CHANGELOG update)
- [ ] Publish v1.9.9 to npm if desired
- [ ] Close any related issues

### Future Improvements
- Consider using conventional-changelog or similar tool
- Could auto-generate CHANGELOG.md from git commits
- Ensure all PRs update CHANGELOG.md going forward

## Lessons Learned

1. **Documentation Duplication is Problematic**
   - Multiple sources of truth lead to inconsistencies
   - Automation is better than manual synchronization
   - Pick one source, generate the rest

2. **Release Process Works Well**
   - GitFlow branch strategy effective
   - CI/CD pipeline caught all issues
   - CodeQL suppressions properly configured

3. **Hotfix Process Smooth**
   - Quick turnaround for documentation fixes
   - Proper backporting to develop
   - Good use of GitFlow for emergency fixes
