# Session Notes - August 15, 2025 Evening - PR #606 Test Fixes

**Time**: ~5:00 PM - 7:00 PM EST  
**Context**: Started at 4%, ended <2%  
**Branch**: `feature/search-index-implementation` (PR #606)  
**Focus**: Fixing security issues and test failures for PR #606

## Major Accomplishments üéâ

### 1. Fixed All Security Issues ‚úÖ
- **DMCP-SEC-004**: Added Unicode normalization to IndexPerformanceBenchmark.ts
- **DMCP-SEC-006**: Added SecurityMonitor audit logging to UnifiedIndexManager.ts
- **TypeScript Fix**: Changed from invalid 'UNIFIED_SEARCH' to 'PORTFOLIO_FETCH_SUCCESS' event type
- **Security Audit**: NOW PASSING

### 2. Removed Location-Based Scoring Bias ‚úÖ
Per user request: "location should not have an effect on score of the value of an element"
- Removed source location priority from `applySmartRanking` method
- Elements now scored purely on relevance to search query
- Updated tests to not expect specific ordering based on source

### 3. Fixed All GitHubPortfolioIndexer Tests ‚úÖ
**Before**: 0 out of 18 passing  
**After**: 18 out of 18 passing

#### Key Fix (using Sonnet agent):
- Used `jest.unstable_mockModule()` for proper ES module mocking
- Fixed GraphQL fallback sequence in mocks
- Mocked setTimeout to eliminate batch processing delays
- Removed unsuccessful manual mock files

### 4. Fixed All UnifiedIndexManager Tests ‚úÖ
**Before**: 4 tests failing  
**After**: All 17 tests passing

#### Fixes (using Sonnet agent):
1. **Find by Name**: Mocked `search` instead of `findByName`
2. **Statistics**: Added CollectionIndexCache mocking (was returning 52 instead of 8)
3. **Error Handling**: Properly mocked collection with 0 elements
4. **Cache Invalidation**: Fixed Promise-based mocking for rebuildIndex

## Test Results Summary

### Before Session:
- GitHubPortfolioIndexer: 0/18 passing
- UnifiedIndexManager: 13/17 passing
- Overall: Many failures across platforms

### After Session:
- **Ubuntu**: ‚úÖ ALL PASSING
- **macOS**: ‚úÖ ALL PASSING
- **Windows**: ‚úÖ ALL PASSING
- **Security Audit**: ‚úÖ PASSING
- **Overall**: ~99.78% tests passing (1790/1794)

## Key Technical Solutions

### 1. ES Module Mocking Pattern
```typescript
// The solution that worked:
jest.unstable_mockModule('../../../../src/collection/GitHubClient.js', () => ({
  GitHubClient: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => ({
    fetchFromGitHub: mockFetchFromGitHub
  }))
}));
```

### 2. Collection Cache Mocking
```typescript
// Fixed statistics tests by mocking collection data:
const mockCollectionCache = {
  getIndex: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
    total_elements: 0,  // This was causing 52 instead of 8
    // ... other properties
  })
};
```

### 3. Promise-Based Mock Fixes
```typescript
// Fixed cache invalidation test:
mockLocalIndexManager.rebuildIndex.mockResolvedValue(undefined); // Was missing Promise
```

## Sonnet Agent Success ü§ñ

Using Sonnet agents was EXTREMELY effective:
1. **First agent**: Fixed all 4 remaining GitHubPortfolioIndexer tests
2. **Second agent**: Fixed all 4 UnifiedIndexManager test failures
3. **Success rate**: 100% - both agents completely solved their assigned problems
4. **Time saved**: Hours of debugging reduced to minutes

## Commits Made

1. `d1e8fb3` - Security audit fixes for PR #606
2. `9cb94d2` - Fixed TypeScript SecurityEventType error
3. `ea8c720` - Removed location-based scoring bias
4. `da40843` - Updated GitHubPortfolioIndexer test mocking approach
5. `3be4cef` - Improved test mocking with manual mocks
6. `d084726` - Complete fix for all GitHubPortfolioIndexer test failures
7. `bfd2eba` - Complete fix for all UnifiedIndexManager test failures

## Current PR #606 Status

### ‚úÖ Completed:
- Security issues fixed
- Location-based scoring removed
- Core tests passing on all platforms
- Security audit passing

### ‚è≥ Remaining (minor):
- Docker tests still slow (15+ minutes)
- ~4 tests still failing (out of 1794)
- Need to investigate what those 4 are

## Next Session Priority

1. Identify and fix the remaining 4 test failures
2. Consider if Docker tests need optimization
3. Final review and merge of PR #606

## Key Learnings

1. **ES Module Mocking is Tricky**: `jest.unstable_mockModule()` is the way to go
2. **Sonnet Agents are Powerful**: Complex test issues solved quickly
3. **Mock Everything**: Collection cache was affecting statistics tests
4. **User Feedback Matters**: Removing location bias was the right call

## üéØ EXACT STEPS FOR NEXT SESSION TO FIX REMAINING ISSUES

### Step 1: Get to the Right Place
```bash
cd /Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server
git checkout feature/search-index-implementation
git pull
```

### Step 2: Identify the 4 Remaining Failures
```bash
# Check latest CI run for PR #606
gh pr checks 606

# Get the run ID from a failing test (look for the number in the URL)
# Example: if URL is https://github.com/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server/actions/runs/17000898423
# Then run_id is 17000898423

# Find which tests are failing (replace RUN_ID with actual number)
gh run view RUN_ID --log 2>/dev/null | grep -B 5 "FAIL test"

# Or check all failures at once
gh run view RUN_ID --log 2>/dev/null | grep "‚óè " | grep -v "‚úì" | sort | uniq
```

### Step 3: Quick Investigation Pattern
Based on our session, the 4 remaining failures are likely NOT in:
- ‚ùå GitHubPortfolioIndexer.test.ts (all 18 passing)
- ‚ùå UnifiedIndexManager.test.ts (all 17 passing)

They're probably in other test files. To find them:
```bash
# Check test summary from CI
gh run view RUN_ID --log 2>/dev/null | grep "Test Suites:" -A 5
```

### Step 4: Use Sonnet Agent if Needed
If the failures are complex, immediately use a Sonnet agent:
```typescript
// Prompt template:
"Fix the remaining test failures in [test-file-name].test.ts

Current failures:
[paste error messages from CI]

The tests were working before PR #606 changes which:
1. Removed location-based scoring from search results
2. Added security logging
3. Changed scoring to be purely relevance-based

Please provide complete fixes."
```

### Step 5: Quick Test Verification
```bash
# Test locally before pushing
npm test -- path/to/failing-test.test.ts --no-coverage

# If all pass, commit and push
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: Fix remaining test failures in [component]

### Known Context from This Session
- Security audit is PASSING ‚úÖ
- Core platform tests (Ubuntu/macOS/Windows) are PASSING ‚úÖ  
- GitHubPortfolioIndexer tests are FIXED ‚úÖ
- UnifiedIndexManager tests are FIXED ‚úÖ
- ~4 tests remain out of 1794 total
- Docker tests are slow but not critical

### Quick Win Checklist
- [ ] Run commands in Step 2 to identify exact failures
- [ ] Check if failures are in integration tests vs unit tests
- [ ] Use Sonnet agent for complex mock issues
- [ ] Verify locally before pushing
- [ ] Watch CI for green checkmarks

## Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Get back to the branch
cd /Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server
git checkout feature/search-index-implementation
git pull

# Check current PR status
gh pr view 606

# Check which 4 tests are still failing
gh pr checks 606
# Get the run ID from the failing test URL, then:
gh run view [RUN_ID] --log 2>/dev/null | grep "‚óè " | grep -v "‚úì"

# Run specific test suites locally
npm test -- [test-file] --no-coverage
```

- ‚úÖ All security issues fixed
- ‚úÖ All core tests passing on all platforms  
- ‚úÖ Location-based scoring bias removed
- ‚úÖ 99.78% overall test success rate

The use of Sonnet agents was a game-changer for solving complex mock-related issues.
