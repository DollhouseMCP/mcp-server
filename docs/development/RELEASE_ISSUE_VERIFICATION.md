# Release Issue Verification Procedure

## Overview

This procedure ensures that all issues mentioned in a release are properly closed after the release merges to `main`. This prevents issues from remaining open after they've been fixed.

## The Problem

Issues can remain open even after being fixed because:
1. PR descriptions missing `Fixes #XXX` keywords
2. Issues mentioned only in release notes, not in individual PRs
3. Multiple PRs for one issue, only one linked
4. Manual release notes without proper GitHub references

## The Solution

**Two-tier approach:**

### 1. Automated Verification (GitHub Action)

When a release PR merges to `main`, the `release-issue-verification.yml` workflow:
- ‚úÖ Extracts all issue numbers from release notes
- ‚úÖ Checks if each issue is open or closed
- ‚úÖ Posts a verification report as a PR comment
- ‚úÖ Auto-closes any open issues with reference to the release
- ‚úÖ Uploads verification report as artifact

**This runs automatically** - no manual action needed for future releases.

### 2. Manual Cleanup (For Historical Issues)

Use the script to clean up old releases:

```bash
# Check a specific release PR
node scripts/verify-release-issues.js --pr 1238

# Check a specific release tag
node scripts/verify-release-issues.js --tag v1.9.16

# Actually close the issues (dry-run by default)
node scripts/verify-release-issues.js --pr 1238 --close

# Verbose output for debugging
node scripts/verify-release-issues.js --pr 1238 --close --verbose
```

## Usage Guide

### For Future Releases (Automated)

**Nothing to do!** The GitHub Action runs automatically when:
- A PR titled "Release v*" merges to `main`
- The workflow has `issues: write` permission

**You'll see:**
1. Verification report posted as PR comment
2. Open issues auto-closed with reference to release
3. Report artifact uploaded for review

### For Historical Cleanup

**Step 1: Find releases to check**
```bash
# List recent release PRs
gh pr list --base main --state merged --limit 10 | grep "Release v"

# Or list tags
gh release list --limit 10
```

**Step 2: Verify issues (dry-run)**
```bash
# Check what issues are referenced
node scripts/verify-release-issues.js --pr 1238

# Example output:
# üîç Release Issue Verification
#
# Found 6 issue references: #1220, #1221, #1222, #1224, #1228, #1236
#
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  #1214: enhancement(formatter): Add configuration option (OPEN)
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  #1211: fix(formatter): ElementFormatter hits scanner false positives (OPEN)
#
# üìä Summary:
#   ‚úÖ Already closed: 4
#   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Still open: 2
#   ‚ùì Not found: 0
```

**Step 3: Review open issues**
- Check if they were actually fixed in the release
- Verify the release notes mention them
- Confirm they should be closed

**Step 4: Close issues**
```bash
# Actually close the verified issues
node scripts/verify-release-issues.js --pr 1238 --close
```

**Step 5: Document results**
Add to session notes:
```markdown
## Release Issue Verification

Ran verification for v1.9.16 (PR #1238):
- 4 issues already closed
- 2 issues closed manually: #1214, #1211
- All release issues now properly tracked
```

## How It Works

### Issue Number Extraction

The script finds issue numbers in multiple formats:
- `#123` - Direct issue reference
- `Issue #123` - Explicit issue mention
- `Fixes #123` - GitHub auto-close keyword
- `PR #123` - Pull request reference (checked as issues)

### Verification Logic

For each found issue number:
1. Query GitHub API for issue status
2. If not found ‚Üí mark as "not found" (may be PR or external)
3. If closed ‚Üí mark as "already closed" ‚úÖ
4. If open ‚Üí mark as "needs closing" ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Auto-Close Behavior

When closing an issue:
```
Closing as completed in PR #1238.
```

This creates an audit trail linking the issue to the release.

## Best Practices

### During Development

**Always link PRs to issues:**
```markdown
## Summary

Fixes memory loading bug

## Changes

- Fixed ElementFormatter security validation

Fixes #1211
```

**In release notes, reference issues:**
```markdown
### Bug Fixes
- **Issue #1211** - Fixed ElementFormatter security scanner false positives (PR #1212)
- **Issue #1213** - Fixed portfolio search file extensions (PR #1215)
```

### After Release to Main

**Automated workflow handles:**
1. ‚úÖ Verification of all referenced issues
2. ‚úÖ Auto-closing with proper reference
3. ‚úÖ Posting report to PR
4. ‚úÖ Uploading artifact

**You should:**
1. Review the verification report comment
2. Check artifact if issues arise
3. Manually verify any "not found" issues

### Historical Cleanup

**Quarterly or after major releases:**
```bash
# Check last 5 releases
for pr in 1238 1230 1217 1210 1201; do
  echo "Checking PR #$pr"
  node scripts/verify-release-issues.js --pr $pr --close
done
```

## Troubleshooting

### Script Errors

**"Must provide either --pr or --tag"**
- Solution: Add `--pr <number>` or `--tag <version>`

**"Release tag not found"**
- Solution: Use `gh release list` to find correct tag name
- Tags are usually `v1.9.16` format

**"Failed to close issue"**
- Check GitHub token has `issues: write` permission
- Verify you're authenticated: `gh auth status`

### GitHub Action Failures

**Workflow doesn't run**
- Check PR title starts with "Release v"
- Verify PR was merged (not closed)
- Check workflow permissions in repo settings

**Issues not closed**
- Check workflow logs in Actions tab
- Verify `GH_TOKEN` has correct permissions
- Look for errors in verification report artifact

**False positives**
- Review "not found" issues manually
- May be PRs referenced as issues
- May be from other repositories

## Integration with Release Process

### Current Release Workflow

1. Create release PR from develop ‚Üí main
2. PR title: "Release v1.9.X"
3. PR body: Release notes with issue references
4. Get approvals
5. **Merge to main** ‚Üê Triggers verification workflow
6. Tag and publish

### Enhanced with Verification

1-4. (Same as above)
5. **Merge to main**
   - ‚úÖ Verification workflow runs automatically
   - ‚úÖ Posts report as comment
   - ‚úÖ Closes referenced issues
6. Review verification report
7. Tag and publish

## Examples

### Example 1: Dry-Run Check

```bash
$ node scripts/verify-release-issues.js --pr 1238

üîç Release Issue Verification

Checking release PR #1238...

‚ö†Ô∏è  #1214: enhancement(formatter): Add configuration option (OPEN)
‚ö†Ô∏è  #1211: fix(formatter): ElementFormatter hits scanner (OPEN)

üìä Summary:
  ‚úÖ Already closed: 4
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Still open: 2
  ‚ùì Not found: 0

üìù Open Issues:

‚úÖ All referenced issues are properly closed!
```

## Configuration

### Script Location
`scripts/verify-release-issues.js`

### Workflow Location
`.github/workflows/release-issue-verification.yml`

### Required Permissions

**For local script:**
- GitHub CLI authenticated (`gh auth login`)
- Read access to repository

**For GitHub Action:**
- `issues: write` - to close issues
- `pull-requests: write` - to post comments
- `contents: read` - to checkout repo

## Maintenance

### When to Update

**Script needs update if:**
- New issue reference formats emerge
- GitHub API changes
- Need additional verification logic

**Workflow needs update if:**
- Release process changes
- Permission requirements change
- Want different trigger conditions

### Testing Changes

```bash
# Test on a known release
node scripts/verify-release-issues.js --pr 1238 --verbose

# Test workflow locally (requires act)
act pull_request --eventpath test-event.json
```

## FAQ

**Q: What if an issue was mentioned but shouldn't be closed?**
A: Don't include it in release notes, or use "Related to #XXX" instead of "Fixes #XXX"

**Q: Can I run this on old releases?**
A: Yes! Use `--pr` or `--tag` to check any historical release

**Q: What if the script closes the wrong issue?**
A: Reopen it manually and add a comment explaining why. Update release notes to not reference it.

**Q: Does this work for Dependabot PRs?**
A: No - only for release PRs (title starting with "Release v")

**Q: What about issues from other repos?**
A: They'll show as "not found" - manually verify if needed
