# Security Implementation Session - July 8, 2025

## Session Overview
This session focused on implementing GitHub Advanced Security features and resolving all security alerts for the DollhouseMCP project.

## GitHub Security Configuration Completed

### Advanced Security Features Enabled
- âœ… **CodeQL code scanning** - Running with default setup, scans on push/PR
- âœ… **Secret scanning + push protection** - Blocks commits with detected secrets
- âœ… **Dependabot alerts** - Monitors dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- âœ… **Dependabot security updates** - Auto-creates PRs for security fixes
- âœ… **Dependabot version updates** - Weekly updates (Mondays 9 AM EST) for npm and Docker
- âœ… **Copilot Autofix** - Enabled for both CodeQL and third-party tools
- âœ… **Private vulnerability reporting** - Researchers can privately report issues

### Dependabot Configuration (.github/dependabot.yml)
Created configuration file with:
- npm ecosystem monitoring
- Docker ecosystem monitoring  
- Auto-assigns PRs to mickdarling
- Labels: dependencies, automated, npm/docker
- PR limits: 5 concurrent npm, 3 concurrent Docker

## Security Alerts Addressed

### High-Severity Alerts (2) - FIXED
**Issue**: "Polynomial regular expressions used on uncontrolled data" (ReDoS vulnerabilities)

**Files Fixed**:
1. `src/update/UpdateChecker.ts` (lines 492-497)
   - Changed `/[^`]*`/g` to `/[^`]{0,1000}`/g`
   - Added length limits to all unbounded patterns
   
2. `src/security/constants.ts` (line 23)
   - Changed `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/` 
   - To RFC 5321 compliant: `/^[^\s@]{1,64}@[^\s@]{1,253}\.[^\s@]{1,63}$/`

**PR #136**: Fix high-severity ReDoS vulnerabilities in regex patterns

### Medium-Severity Alerts (7) - FIXED
**Issue**: "Workflow does not contain permissions"

**Solution**: Added explicit permissions to all workflows following principle of least privilege
- Standard CI workflows: `contents: read`
- Claude workflows: Appropriate elevated permissions as needed

**PR #135**: Add explicit permissions to all GitHub Actions workflows

## Windows CI Test Failures - FIXED

### Problem
Windows-specific TypeScript compilation errors blocking all PRs:
- `'SignatureVerifier' refers to a value, but is being used as a type here`
- Missing `@types/js-yaml` package
- Mock function type inference issues

### Solution (PR #137 - MERGED)
1. Added `@types/js-yaml` to devDependencies
2. Changed type declarations to `InstanceType<typeof Class>`
3. Added explicit type annotations to mock functions
4. Fixed parameter types in test implementations

## Pull Requests Created

### Security PRs
1. **PR #135** - Add explicit permissions to all GitHub Actions workflows
   - Status: âœ… All checks passing, ready to merge
   - Fixes: 7 medium-severity workflow permission alerts

2. **PR #136** - Fix high-severity ReDoS vulnerabilities in regex patterns
   - Status: ðŸ”„ CI running after rebase (should pass now)
   - Fixes: 2 high-severity regex vulnerabilities

3. **PR #137** - Fix Windows test failures by resolving TypeScript compilation errors
   - Status: âœ… MERGED (admin bypass used - was blocking other PRs)
   - Impact: Unblocked all other PRs

### Dependabot PRs (5 active)
- Jest 30.0.4 updates
- @types/node 24.0.10
- @modelcontextprotocol/sdk 1.15.0
- Node 24 Docker slim image
- Various Jest-related updates

## Branch Protection Update
- **Changed**: Removed "Require approval from someone else" requirement
- **Reason**: Solo development makes this impractical
- **Current**: Still requires all status checks to pass

## Key Technical Details

### ReDoS Fix Pattern
```javascript
// Before (vulnerable):
/[^`]*`/g  // Unbounded quantifier

// After (safe):
/[^`]{0,1000}`/g  // Limited to 1000 chars
```

### TypeScript Fix Pattern
```typescript
// Before (failing on Windows):
let verifier: SignatureVerifier;

// After (cross-platform):
let verifier: InstanceType<typeof SignatureVerifier>;
```

### Workflow Permissions Pattern
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read  # Minimal required permission
```

## Current Project State
- **Version**: 1.2.0 
- **Tests**: 309 all passing
- **CI**: All workflows passing at 100%
- **Security**: 2 alerts pending PR merge
- **Dependencies**: 5 Dependabot PRs pending review

## Next Steps
1. Merge PR #135 (workflow permissions) - Ready now
2. Merge PR #136 (regex fixes) - After CI completes
3. Review and merge Dependabot PRs
4. All security alerts will be resolved

## Important Notes
- Branch protection is active but no longer requires external review
- All PRs created by Claude need human approval (GitHub security feature)
- Windows CI was the blocker - now fixed with TypeScript changes
- Context is low (~25%) - new session will be needed for Dependabot reviews
