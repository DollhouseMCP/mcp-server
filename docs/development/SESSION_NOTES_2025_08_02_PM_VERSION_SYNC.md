# Session Notes - August 2, 2025 PM - Version Sync & Release

## Session Overview
**Date**: August 2, 2025 (Afternoon)  
**Focus**: Resolving version conflicts between main (v1.3.3) and develop (v1.3.4)  
**Result**: In progress - merging main into develop with conflicts  

## Critical Discovery

### The Version Gap Issue
- **Main branch**: Has v1.3.3 (released July 29) with plural element names ('skills', 'personas')
- **Develop branch**: Has v1.3.4 with singular names ('skill', 'persona') and more features
- **Root cause**: v1.3.3 was released to main while we were developing v1.3.4, but develop was never synced

### Key Differences Between Versions
1. **Element Type Naming**:
   - v1.3.3 (main): Uses plurals - 'personas', 'skills', 'templates', 'agents'
   - v1.3.4 (develop): Uses singular - 'persona', 'skill', 'template', 'agent', 'memory', 'ensemble'

2. **MCP Tools**:
   - v1.3.3 (main): 8 tools (basic operations)
   - v1.3.4 (develop): 12 tools (includes CRUD: create_element, edit_element, validate_element, delete_element)

3. **Element Types**:
   - v1.3.3 (main): 4 types (personas, skills, templates, agents)
   - v1.3.4 (develop): 6 types (adds memory, ensemble as placeholders)

## Important Decisions Made

1. **Use Singular Naming** - This is the standard going forward
2. **Keep CRUD Tools** - Essential for element management
3. **Keep Memory/Ensemble as Placeholders** - No functionality, just enum values
4. **Release as v1.4.0** - Cleaner than v1.3.4 given the changes
5. **Do This Properly** - Full sync rather than quick fixes

## Current Status

### What We've Done
1. ✅ Closed PR #435 (v1.3.4 release) to do proper sync
2. ✅ Started merging main into develop
3. ⚠️ Currently resolving merge conflicts (partially complete)

### Conflicts Being Resolved
Files with conflicts (status):
- ✅ package.json - Changed to v1.4.0
- ✅ security-audit-report.md - Kept develop version
- ✅ src/portfolio/types.ts - Kept singular naming with memory/ensemble
- ❌ src/server/types.ts - Not resolved yet
- ❌ src/server/tools/ElementTools.ts - Not resolved yet
- ❌ src/elements/skills/SkillManager.ts - Not resolved yet
- ❌ src/index.ts - Not resolved yet
- ❌ test/__tests__/unit/elements/skills/SkillManager.test.ts - Not resolved yet
- ❌ test/__tests__/unit/server/tools/ElementTools.test.ts - Not resolved yet

## Next Session Tasks

### 1. Complete Merge Conflict Resolution
For each remaining file, keep:
- Singular element type names
- All 12 tools (including CRUD operations)
- 'content' field (not 'instructions')
- Memory and ensemble in enums only

### 2. Key Conflicts to Resolve

#### src/server/types.ts
Keep the HEAD version with all 4 CRUD methods:
```typescript
createElement(args: {name: string; type: string; description: string; content?: string; metadata?: Record<string, any>}): Promise<any>;
editElement(args: {name: string; type: string; field: string; value: any}): Promise<any>;
validateElement(args: {name: string; type: string; strict?: boolean}): Promise<any>;
deleteElement(args: {name: string; type: string; deleteData?: boolean}): Promise<any>;
```

#### src/server/tools/ElementTools.ts
- Keep all 12 tools (HEAD version)
- Use 'content' not 'instructions' in CreateElementArgs
- Include DeleteElementArgs interface

#### src/elements/skills/SkillManager.ts
- Keep the create() method from HEAD
- Keep HEAD version entirely

#### test files
- Update to expect 12 tools (not 8)
- Use singular 'skill' not 'skills' in paths

### 3. After Conflicts Resolved
1. Commit the merge
2. Create release/v1.4.0 branch
3. Update CHANGELOG.md for v1.4.0
4. Create PR from release/v1.4.0 to main
5. This time should have NO conflicts

## Key Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Continue from where we left off
cd /Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server
git status

# After resolving remaining conflicts
git add .
git commit -m "Merge main (v1.3.3) into develop with v1.4.0 changes

- Resolved naming conflicts in favor of singular element types
- Kept all 12 MCP tools including CRUD operations
- Updated version to 1.4.0
- Maintained memory/ensemble as placeholders"

# Create release branch
git checkout -b release/v1.4.0
git push -u origin release/v1.4.0

# Create PR
gh pr create --base main --title "Release v1.4.0 - Element System with Singular Naming"
```

## Important Context

### Legal Constraints
- Memory and Ensemble can exist as enum values/placeholders
- NO actual implementation code for these types
- They're reserved for future use pending legal approval

### Architecture Decisions
- Singular naming is the standard (skill not skills)
- CRUD tools are essential part of the system
- LLM interface will handle plural/singular automatically

## Detailed Conflict Resolution Guide

### For src/server/types.ts
The conflict is about the CRUD methods. Main branch doesn't have them, develop does.
**Resolution**: Keep ALL the methods from HEAD (develop):
```typescript
// Around line 24-28, keep this entire block:
createElement(args: {name: string; type: string; description: string; content?: string; metadata?: Record<string, any>}): Promise<any>;
editElement(args: {name: string; type: string; field: string; value: any}): Promise<any>;
validateElement(args: {name: string; type: string; strict?: boolean}): Promise<any>;
deleteElement(args: {name: string; type: string; deleteData?: boolean}): Promise<any>;
```

### For src/server/tools/ElementTools.ts
Multiple conflicts here:
1. **CreateElementArgs interface** (line 38-41): Keep 'content' from HEAD, not 'instructions'
2. **ValidateElementArgs interface** (line 56-58): Keep 'strict?' parameter from HEAD
3. **DeleteElementArgs interface** (line 60-64): Keep entire interface from HEAD
4. **Tool implementations** (line 241-370): Keep ALL 4 CRUD tools from HEAD

### For src/elements/skills/SkillManager.ts
The conflict is about the create() method (line 202-238).
**Resolution**: Keep the ENTIRE create() method from HEAD including security fixes

### For test/__tests__/unit/elements/skills/SkillManager.test.ts
Multiple path conflicts where main uses 'skills' and develop uses 'skill':
- Line 75: Use 'skill' not 'skills'
- Line 117: Use 'skill' not 'skills'
- Line 148: Use 'skill' not 'skills'
- Line 172: Use 'skill' not 'skills'
- Line 189: Use 'skill' not 'skills'
- Line 239: Use 'skill' not 'skills'

### For test/__tests__/unit/server/tools/ElementTools.test.ts
1. **Mock setup** (line 25-33): Keep all CRUD method mocks from HEAD
2. **Tool count test** (line 40-46): Expect 12 tools, not 8
3. **Tool names test** (line 59-64): Keep all 4 CRUD tool names from HEAD

### For src/index.ts
Need to check what conflicts exist here - likely related to element type usage.

## Understanding the Conflicts Pattern

The main pattern across all conflicts is:
- **Main (v1.3.3)**: Has plural names, 8 tools, no CRUD operations
- **Develop (v1.3.4)**: Has singular names, 12 tools, full CRUD operations
- **Resolution**: Always keep develop's version with adjustments for v1.4.0

## Full File List to Check After Resume

```bash
# Check status of all conflicted files
git status --porcelain | grep "^UU"

# Files that should show as resolved (already done):
# M  package.json
# M  security-audit-report.md  
# M  src/portfolio/types.ts

# Files that need resolution:
# UU src/server/types.ts
# UU src/server/tools/ElementTools.ts
# UU src/elements/skills/SkillManager.ts
# UU src/index.ts
# UU test/__tests__/unit/elements/skills/SkillManager.test.ts
# UU test/__tests__/unit/server/tools/ElementTools.test.ts
```

## Context for Next Session

### Why This Happened
- We started v1.3.4 development when main was at v1.3.2
- Someone released v1.3.3 to main with plural naming
- Our develop branch never got that update
- Now we're syncing and going to v1.4.0 with proper singular naming

### The Goal
Create a clean v1.4.0 release that:
- Establishes singular naming as the standard
- Includes all CRUD operations for elements
- Keeps memory/ensemble as future placeholders
- Properly syncs develop with main for clean GitFlow

### Critical Remember
- **NO** functionality for memory/ensemble (legal requirement)
- **YES** to keeping them as enum values for future
- **SINGULAR** naming is our standard
- **ALL 12 TOOLS** must be included

## Session Metrics
- **PRs Closed**: 1 (#435)
- **Merge Started**: main → develop
- **Conflicts Resolved**: 3/9 files
- **Remaining Conflicts**: 6 files
- **Time**: ~45 minutes
- **Status**: Paused due to context limits

## Exact Commands to Run Next Session

### 1. Start Where We Left Off
```bash
cd /Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server
git status
# Should show we're in the middle of a merge with 6 unresolved files
```

### 2. Resolve Each Remaining Conflict

#### Fix src/server/types.ts
```bash
# Open the file and find the conflict around line 24
# Keep the HEAD version with all 4 CRUD methods
# The conflict looks like:
<<<<<<< HEAD
createElement(args: {...}): Promise<any>;
editElement(args: {...}): Promise<any>;
validateElement(args: {...}): Promise<any>;
deleteElement(args: {...}): Promise<any>;
=======
>>>>>>> origin/main

# Resolution: Delete the conflict markers and keep all 4 methods
```

#### Fix src/server/tools/ElementTools.ts
```bash
# This file has 4 separate conflicts:
# 1. Line 38-41: Keep 'content' not 'instructions'
# 2. Line 56-58: Keep the strict? parameter
# 3. Line 60-64: Keep the entire DeleteElementArgs interface
# 4. Line 241-370: Keep ALL 4 CRUD tool implementations

# The big conflict at the end looks like:
<<<<<<< HEAD
    // Generic element creation tool
    {
      tool: {
        name: "create_element",
        ...
    },
    ... (3 more tools)
=======
>>>>>>> origin/main

# Resolution: Keep the entire HEAD section with all 4 tools
```

#### Fix src/elements/skills/SkillManager.ts
```bash
# Conflict around line 202-238
# Keep the ENTIRE create() method from HEAD
# It has security fixes and proper implementation
```

#### Fix src/index.ts
```bash
# Need to check what conflicts exist here
# Likely around element type imports or usage
# Keep singular naming convention
```

#### Fix test files
```bash
# For SkillManager.test.ts:
# Replace ALL instances of 'skills' with 'skill' in paths
# Lines: 75, 117, 148, 172, 189, 239

# For ElementTools.test.ts:
# Line 25-33: Keep all CRUD mocks
# Line 41: Change to expect 12 tools
# Line 59-64: Keep all CRUD tool names
```

### 3. Complete the Merge
```bash
# After resolving all conflicts
git add .
git status  # Verify all conflicts resolved

git commit -m "Merge main (v1.3.3) into develop with v1.4.0 changes

- Resolved all conflicts in favor of singular element naming
- Kept all 12 MCP tools including CRUD operations  
- Updated version to 1.4.0
- Preserved memory/ensemble as placeholder types
- Maintained all security fixes and improvements from develop"
```

### 4. Create Release Branch
```bash
git checkout -b release/v1.4.0
git push -u origin release/v1.4.0
```

### 5. Update CHANGELOG
Create/update CHANGELOG entry for v1.4.0:
```markdown
## [1.4.0] - 2025-08-02

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Element types now use singular naming convention (skill, persona, template, agent)
  - Previous: 'skills', 'personas', 'templates', 'agents'
  - New: 'skill', 'persona', 'template', 'agent'
- Standardized element system architecture across all types

### Added
- Generic CRUD operations for all element types
  - create_element - Create any element type
  - edit_element - Modify element metadata and content
  - validate_element - Comprehensive validation with feedback
  - delete_element - Safe deletion with data cleanup
- Memory and Ensemble element types (placeholders for future release)
- Enhanced security throughout element system

### Fixed
- Sync issues between main and develop branches
- Consolidated naming conventions across codebase
```

### 6. Create Release PR
```bash
gh pr create --base main --title "Release v1.4.0 - Standardized Element System" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
# Release v1.4.0 - Standardized Element System

This release establishes singular element type naming as the standard and adds comprehensive CRUD operations.

## Breaking Changes
- Element types now use singular names: 'skill' not 'skills', 'persona' not 'personas', etc.
- This affects the type parameter in all element-related MCP tools

## New Features
- 4 new generic element tools for CRUD operations
- Standardized element system across all types
- Placeholder support for future element types

## Why v1.4.0?
- v1.3.3 was released to main while we were developing
- This properly syncs all branches and establishes clean standards
- Breaking change in naming warrants version bump

## Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Ready for production
