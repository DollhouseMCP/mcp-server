# IMPORTANT: Repository Configuration Note

## Issue Detected
The local repository is still configured to pull from the old persona-mcp-server repository instead of DollhouseMCP/mcp-server.

## Current State
- **Local branch**: main (not updated with PR #209 merge)
- **Remote origin**: https://github.com/mickdarling/persona-mcp-server (OLD)
- **Correct repo**: https://github.com/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server (NEW)

## Fix for Next Session
```bash
# Update remote to correct repository
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server.git

# Fetch and merge the latest changes
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main

# Verify security implementation is present
npm run security:rapid
```

## What This Means
- PR #209 was successfully merged to DollhouseMCP/mcp-server
- Local repository needs to be updated to point to correct remote
- Once updated, all security implementation will be available

## Verification After Fix
```bash
# Should show DollhouseMCP/mcp-server
git remote -v

# Should show security:rapid script
npm run | grep security

# Should show PR #209 merge commit
git log --grep="Security Implementation"
```

This explains why the security scripts aren't available locally - we successfully merged to the DollhouseMCP repository but the local clone is still pointing to the old repository!
