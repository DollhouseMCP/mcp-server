# Initialization Fix Implementation - Issue #610

**Date**: August 16, 2025
**Branch**: fix/server-initialization-race-condition
**Issue**: #610 - Fix race condition in server initialization

## Problem Analysis

### Current Implementation (Race Condition)
In the constructor (lines 97-186):
- Portfolio initialization happens asynchronously with `.then()`
- `personasDir` starts as empty string
- Critical initialization happens in the callback

In the run() method (line 4457):
- Server connects immediately with `await this.server.connect(transport)`
- Doesn't wait for portfolio initialization
- MCP is ready but personas/portfolio aren't loaded

### The Fix
Move initialization to run() method and await it before connecting:
```typescript
async run() {
  // Initialize BEFORE connecting
  await this.initializePortfolio();
  await this.completeInitialization();
  
  // NOW connect MCP
  const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
  await this.server.connect(transport);
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Extract Post-Initialization Logic
Created new method `completeInitialization()` that contains all the logic that was in the `.then()` callback.

### 2. Modified Constructor
- Removed the async `.then()` pattern
- Constructor now only sets up basic state
- No async operations in constructor

### 3. Modified run() Method
- Added await for `initializePortfolio()`
- Added await for `completeInitialization()`
- These complete BEFORE connecting to transport

## Testing

### Local MCP Test âœ…
```bash
# Test with proper parameters
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"1.0.0","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"1.0.0"}},"id":1}' | node dist/index.js 2>/dev/null

# Result: Server responds correctly
{"result":{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","capabilities":{"tools":{}},"serverInfo":{"name":"dollhousemcp","version":"1.0.0"}},"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1}
```

### Docker Test
```bash
docker compose --file docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm -T dollhousemcp
```
Note: Docker environment needs further testing but local MCP is working correctly.

## Impact

This fix ensures:
1. Portfolio and personas are loaded before MCP connects
2. No race condition between initialization and commands
3. Docker tests should pass
4. PR #606 is unblocked
