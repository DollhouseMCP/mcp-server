# Session Notes - August 6, 2025 - GitHub Authentication Implementation

## Session Context

**Time**: Morning session
**Branch**: `feature/github-auth-device-flow`
**Focus**: Implement seamless GitHub authentication using OAuth device flow
**Issue**: #462

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Research & Planning ✅

**Discovered Key Insights:**
- Public repos don't need auth for browsing/installing (already working!)
- GitHub device flow perfect for MCP servers (no browser redirects)
- Device flow handles both signin and signup naturally
- Current submit_content creates GitHub issue URL (not direct submission)

**Authentication Approach Selected:**
- OAuth Device Flow (recommended by GitHub for CLI/desktop apps)
- No client secrets required
- 15-minute auth window
- Works entirely within MCP stdio transport

### 2. Created Comprehensive GitHub Issue #462 ✅

Documented the entire authentication plan including:
- Problem statement
- Solution approach
- Implementation details
- User experience flows
- Technical requirements
- Success criteria

### 3. Implemented GitHubAuthManager ✅

**Key Features:**
- OAuth device flow implementation
- Token validation and user info retrieval
- Smart polling with configurable intervals
- Rate limiting protection
- Clear error handling
- Natural language instructions

**File**: `src/auth/GitHubAuthManager.ts`

### 4. Created MCP Authentication Tools ✅

**New Tools Added:**
- `setup_github_auth` - Initiates device flow
- `check_github_auth` - Shows auth status
- `clear_github_auth` - Removes credentials

**Files Modified:**
- `src/server/tools/AuthTools.ts` (created)
- `src/server/types.ts` (added auth methods)
- `src/server/ServerSetup.ts` (registered tools)

### 5. Implemented Auth Handler Methods ✅

Added to `src/index.ts`:
- `setupGitHubAuth()` - Handles device flow initiation
- `checkGitHubAuth()` - Reports current auth status
- `clearGitHubAuth()` - Disconnects from GitHub
- `pollForAuthCompletion()` - Background polling

**Key Features:**
- Natural language responses
- Clear status indicators
- Graceful error handling
- Background polling for completion

### 6. Enhanced submit_content ✅

Updated to check authentication before submission:
- Detects if user is authenticated
- Provides clear guidance if not
- Natural language prompts
- Explains why GitHub is needed

## Technical Implementation Details

### OAuth Device Flow
1. User initiates with natural language ("connect to GitHub")
2. Server requests device code from GitHub
3. User visits github.com/login/device
4. User enters 8-character code
5. Server polls for completion
6. Token stored for future use

### Security Considerations
- No client secrets in code
- Rate limiting on all API calls
- Token validation before use
- Clear permission scopes
- Secure error messages

### User Experience Improvements
- Browse/install work without auth (public repo)
- Only submit requires authentication
- Natural language throughout
- No technical commands
- Clear explanations

## Current Status

### What's Complete
- ✅ GitHubAuthManager implementation
- ✅ MCP tools for authentication
- ✅ Natural language responses
- ✅ Submit flow with auth check
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Feature branch created
- ✅ Initial commit pushed

### What's Pending
- [ ] Natural language intent detection
- [ ] Secure token storage (currently logs instructions)
- [ ] Testing with real GitHub OAuth app
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] PR creation and review

## Key Code Locations

### New Files
- `/src/auth/GitHubAuthManager.ts` - Core auth implementation
- `/src/server/tools/AuthTools.ts` - MCP tool definitions

### Modified Files
- `/src/index.ts` - Auth handler methods (lines 2134-2283)
- `/src/server/types.ts` - Added auth tool interfaces
- `/src/server/ServerSetup.ts` - Tool registration

## Configuration Needed

**GitHub OAuth App:**
- Currently using placeholder client ID
- Need to register official DollhouseMCP OAuth app
- Enable device flow in app settings
- Update CLIENT_ID in GitHubAuthManager

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Create Pull Request**
   - Add comprehensive PR description
   - Reference issue #462
   - Request review

2. **Implement Secure Token Storage**
   - System keychain integration
   - Encrypted file fallback
   - Environment variable support

3. **Add Natural Language Detection**
   - Detect "connect to GitHub" phrases
   - Auto-trigger auth setup
   - Smart intent recognition

4. **Testing**
   - Register test OAuth app
   - Test device flow end-to-end
   - Verify new user experience
   - Test auth persistence

## Important Context

### User Requirements
- "It just works" experience
- No manual token setup
- Natural language interaction
- Support for new GitHub users
- Clear guidance throughout

### Technical Decisions
- Device flow over other OAuth methods (no redirect handling)
- Issues over PRs for submissions (simpler)
- Background polling for auth completion
- Natural language over commands

## Session Summary

This was a highly productive session implementing GitHub OAuth device flow authentication. We:
- Researched and selected the optimal approach
- Implemented core authentication system
- Added natural language MCP tools
- Enhanced submit flow with auth checking
- Created clean, well-documented code

The implementation provides the seamless experience users expect - browse and install work immediately, while submit gracefully prompts for authentication when needed.

## Git Status

**Branch**: `feature/github-auth-device-flow`
**Commits**: 1 commit ahead of develop
**Last Commit**: "feat: Implement GitHub OAuth device flow authentication"
**Ready for**: PR creation
