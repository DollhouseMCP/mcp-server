# Session Notes - August 31, 2025 - CI Fixes and README Work

## Session Context
**Time**: Morning session
**Starting Issue**: PR #844 CI failures with portfolio test
**Ending Context**: 12% remaining, need fresh session for README work

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Portfolio Test Failures (PR #846) ✅ MERGED
**Problem**: `portfolio-single-upload.qa.test.ts` failing across all platforms
- Expected `PORTFOLIO_SYNC_001` (auth error) but got `PORTFOLIO_SYNC_005` (generic error)
- Dual test system (compiled fallback) was adding confusion

**Root Cause**: 
- Authentication errors during file existence checks were being swallowed
- Error classification relied on fragile string parsing instead of HTTP status codes

**Solution**:
1. Disabled compiled test fallback in CI workflow
2. Fixed error handling to re-throw 401/403 errors (not "file doesn't exist")  
3. Improved error classification to use HTTP status codes first
4. Added comprehensive inline documentation explaining the logic
5. Fixed IndexOptimization test timeout (10s → 30s)

**Key Learning**: The file existence check must re-throw auth errors because 401/403 are NOT "file doesn't exist" scenarios - they mean we can't access the API at all.

### 2. Fixed Windows Performance Test Timeout (PR #847) ✅ MERGED
**Problem**: Extended Node Compatibility workflow failing on Windows after PR #846
- `portfolio-filtering.performance.test.ts` timing out after 10 seconds
- Test creates and filters 1000 files (slower on Windows)

**Solution**: Increased timeout from 10s to 30s (same as IndexOptimization fix)

## Current State of Develop Branch
✅ **All CI workflows passing** after both PRs merged
- Core Build & Test: Fixed
- Extended Node Compatibility: Fixed  
- All other workflows: Green

## README PR Investigation

### PR #839: "Integrate README build into version bump and release workflow"
- **Status**: OPEN since Aug 30
- **CI Status**: Some tests cancelled, macOS failing
- **Complexity**: Full integration with release workflow

### PR #840: "Integrate README build into version bump (minimal)"
- **Status**: OPEN since Aug 30  
- **CI Status**: Ubuntu and macOS failing
- **Approach**: Minimal changes, simpler than #839

### Analysis
Both PRs are failing CI, likely due to the same test issues we just fixed. However, they were created before the test fixes, so they need to be:
1. Rebased on latest develop (with our fixes)
2. Evaluated for which approach is better
3. Possibly rolled back to simpler implementation

## Next Session Priority: README Work

### Core Changes Needed (from PR #840)
The actual README integration is simple - just two changes:

1. **In `scripts/update-version.mjs`**: Add README building after version bump
   ```javascript
   // Build README files if build script exists
   execSync('npm run build:readme', { stdio: 'inherit', cwd: projectRoot });
   ```

2. **In `.github/workflows/release-npm.yml`**: Build README before NPM publish
   ```yaml
   - name: Build README files
     run: npm run build:readme
   ```

### Recommended Approach
1. **Start fresh session** with full context
2. **Create new clean PR** with just README changes:
   - Cherry-pick ONLY the README build integration
   - Ignore all test-related changes from #839/#840
   - Base on current clean develop branch

### Specific Tasks for Next Session
1. Create new branch from develop
2. Add README building to `update-version.mjs`
3. Add README building to release workflow
4. Test locally with `npm run version:bump`
5. Create clean PR without test complications

### Key Files to Review
- `scripts/build-readme.js` - The README builder
- `package.json` - Version bump scripts
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Release workflow (if using #839)

## Technical Debt Noted
- Performance tests need consistent timeout handling
- Consider extracting timeout values to constants
- Compiled test fallback could be removed entirely (not just disabled)

## Commands for Next Session
```bash
# Start with the minimal PR
gh pr checkout 840
git rebase develop

# Or start completely fresh
git checkout develop
git pull
git checkout -b feature/readme-build-minimal-v2

# Test locally first
npm test
npm run build:readme
```

## Session Summary
Successfully unblocked CI by fixing test failures that had been plaguing multiple PRs. The dual-test system was masking the real issues. With CI now green on develop, we can tackle the README integration work with confidence in the next session.

**Context preserved for next session**: README PRs need evaluation and likely simplification. Start with #840 (minimal) and see if rebasing on fixed develop is enough, or if we need an even simpler approach.
