# Session Notes - September 22, 2025 - Docker Claude Code Authentication Solution

## Session Overview
**Time**: 7:57 AM - 9:15 AM PST (~1h 20min)
**Branch**: main (should create feature branch for Dockerfile update)
**Context**: Investigating and solving Docker Claude Code authentication failure
**Result**: ✅ **COMPLETE SUCCESS** - Found and verified apiKeyHelper solution
**Personas Active**: alex-sterling (investigation), session-notes-writer (documentation)

## Initial Problem Statement

User requested recreation of a previously working Docker setup from September 10, 2025 where Claude Code ran with DollhouseMCP in a container using an API key. Initial testing revealed authentication was failing with "Invalid API key · Please run /login" despite valid API key.

## Investigation Journey

### Phase 1: Test Script Issues and Initial Testing (8:00-8:20 AM)

Started with automated test script that had syntax errors and hung. Pivoted to manual testing which revealed:
- ✅ Docker image builds successfully
- ✅ Claude Code v1.0.110 installs correctly
- ✅ DollhouseMCP v1.9.8 builds and configures
- ✅ API key passes to container
- ❌ **FAILURE**: Claude Code rejects API key

### Phase 2: Authentication Deep Dive (8:20-8:35 AM)

Discovered critical facts:
1. `/login` is NOT a CLI command but exists in user's Claude Code IDE
2. API key verified valid (HTTP 200 from Anthropic API)
3. Neither `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` nor `CLAUDE_API_KEY` env vars work
4. `--api-key` flag doesn't exist
5. Config system has `apiKeyHelper` option (undefined by default)

Key insight from user: `/login` has been a command "for quite a long while" in their Claude Code environment, confirming it's an IDE command, not CLI.

### Phase 3: Web Search Discovery (8:35-8:50 AM)

User wisely suggested web search before context overflow. Findings:
- Multiple GitHub issues report same "Invalid API key" error
- OAuth credential storage issues widespread
- **Critical discovery**: apiKeyHelper script method exists
- Claude Code moved from env var to OAuth-first authentication

### Phase 4: Solution Implementation (8:50-9:05 AM)

Tested apiKeyHelper method:
1. Create script that outputs API key
2. Configure Claude Code to use script
3. SUCCESS - Authentication works!

**Verification Results**:
- Basic response: ✅ PASSED
- MCP tools detected: ✅ 34 tools found
- MCP tool execution: ✅ Version 1.9.8 confirmed

### Phase 5: Documentation and Dockerfile Update (9:05-9:15 AM)

Created comprehensive documentation and updated Dockerfile with permanent fix.

## Technical Solution Details

### Root Cause
Claude Code CLI no longer accepts API keys directly through environment variables. It requires an **apiKeyHelper script** that provides the API key when requested.

### Implementation
```bash
# Create helper script
echo '#!/bin/bash' > ~/.claude/anthropic_key_helper.sh
echo 'echo ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}' >> ~/.claude/anthropic_key_helper.sh
chmod +x ~/.claude/anthropic_key_helper.sh

# Configure Claude Code
claude config set --global apiKeyHelper ~/.claude/anthropic_key_helper.sh

# Now Claude Code works with API authentication
```

### Why September 10 Documentation Missed This
Possible explanations:
1. apiKeyHelper was configured but not documented
2. Authentication method changed between Sept 10-22
3. Different authentication was used but not recorded

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Pivoted from automated testing to manual** when script hung
2. **Documented everything before web search** to preserve context
3. **Tested apiKeyHelper immediately** upon discovery
4. **Created both temporary and permanent solutions**

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
1. `/test/docker-claude-verification/TEST_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive test plan
2. `/test/docker-claude-verification/run-verification.sh` - Automated test script
3. `/test/docker-claude-verification/EXPECTED_OUTPUTS.md` - Expected results guide
4. `/test/docker-claude-verification/README.md` - Test suite documentation
5. `/test/docker-claude-verification/TEST_RUN_RESULTS_20250922.md` - Test results
6. `/test/docker-claude-verification/COMPLETE_FINDINGS_SUMMARY.md` - Pre-search summary
7. `/test/docker-claude-verification/AUTHENTICATION_ISSUE_FINDINGS.md` - Issue analysis
8. `/docs/DOCKER_CLAUDE_CODE_WITH_API_KEY_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md` - Original guide
9. `/docs/DOCKER_CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_SOLUTION.md` - Working solution
10. `/docker/test-configs/Dockerfile.claude-testing.updated` - Fixed Dockerfile

### Modified
1. `/test/docker-claude-verification/run-verification.sh` - Fixed syntax errors

## Lessons Learned

1. **Web search crucial** - Community had already discovered apiKeyHelper solution
2. **Authentication methods evolve** - What worked in September may not work now
3. **Document authentication steps** - Critical setup steps often get missed
4. **Test incrementally** - Manual testing revealed issue faster than automation
5. **Preserve context** - Writing summary before search prevented context loss

## Next Session Setup

### Critical Context Elements
If continuing Docker work:
- Navigate to: `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server`
- Review: `/docs/DOCKER_CLAUDE_CODE_WORKING_SOLUTION.md`

### On-Demand DollhouseMCP Elements

**IF doing Docker/infrastructure work**:
- Tool: `mcp__dollhousemcp-production__activate_element`
- Parameters: `name: "alex-sterling", type: "personas"`
- Purpose: Evidence-based investigation and verification

**IF creating documentation**:
- Tool: `mcp__dollhousemcp-production__activate_element`
- Parameters: `name: "session-notes-writer", type: "personas"`
- Purpose: Comprehensive documentation with context

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. Create feature branch for Dockerfile update
2. Replace original Dockerfile with updated version
3. Test complete build with new Dockerfile
4. Create PR with authentication fix

## Session Success Metrics

- ✅ Found root cause of authentication failure
- ✅ Discovered and verified apiKeyHelper solution
- ✅ Created working implementation
- ✅ Documented complete solution
- ✅ Updated Dockerfile for permanent fix
- ✅ All MCP tools working (34 detected)
- ✅ **Main Dockerfile updated with authentication fix (8:56 AM)**

## Critical Discovery Summary

**THE FIX**: Claude Code CLI needs apiKeyHelper script, not direct env vars
```bash
# This is all that was needed:
claude config set --global apiKeyHelper /path/to/script_that_echoes_api_key
```

## Final Session Addition (8:56 AM)

User requested update of main Dockerfile before session end:

1. **Backed up** original: `Dockerfile.claude-testing.backup`
2. **Replaced** main Dockerfile with fixed version
3. **Built and tested**: New image `claude-mcp-test-env-v2` works perfectly
4. **Verification**: Shows "✅ API authentication configured" and test-auth returns "AUTH_SUCCESS"

Main Dockerfile now permanently includes apiKeyHelper authentication. Ready for capability index testing.
