# Session Notes - October 9, 2025 (Afternoon)

**Date**: October 9, 2025
**Time**: 1:30 PM - 1:50 PM (20 minutes)
**Focus**: Fix incorrect contributor attribution in GitHub issues
**Outcome**: ✅ Successfully corrected all @toddself references to @insomnolence

## Session Summary

Fixed incorrect GitHub username references across 10 issues (#1290-1299) created during today's security audit. Issues were incorrectly attributing security findings to "@toddself" when they should have credited Todd Dibble's correct GitHub handle "@insomnolence".

## Problem

Issues #1290-1299 contained references to "@toddself" (incorrect) instead of "@insomnolence" (correct GitHub handle for Todd Dibble). These references appeared in:
- Issue body text ("Reported by @toddself via security audit")
- First comments on each issue

## Work Completed

### 1. Investigation
- Identified 10 issues created on 2025-10-09 with incorrect attribution
- Found references in both issue bodies AND comments
- Issue #1299 had 2 comments with the incorrect reference

### 2. Fixed Issue Comments (11 total)
Updated comments using GitHub API:
```bash
gh api --method PATCH repos/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server/issues/comments/{COMMENT_ID} \
  --field body='Reported by @insomnolence via security audit'
```

**Comments fixed**:
- Issue #1290: Comment 3386240254
- Issue #1291: Comment 3386240316
- Issue #1292: Comment 3386240391
- Issue #1293: Comment 3386240461
- Issue #1294: Comment 3386240514
- Issue #1295: Comment 3386240619
- Issue #1296: Comment 3386240685
- Issue #1297: Comment 3386240749
- Issue #1298: Comment 3386240798
- Issue #1299: Comments 3386240858, 3386873149

### 3. Fixed Issue Bodies (10 total)
Updated issue descriptions using GitHub API with file-based approach:
```bash
gh api repos/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER} | jq -r '.body' > /tmp/issue.txt
sed 's/@toddself/@insomnolence/g' /tmp/issue.txt > /tmp/fixed.txt
gh api --method PATCH repos/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server/issues/{ISSUE_NUMBER} --field body=@/tmp/fixed.txt
```

**Issue bodies fixed**: #1291, #1292, #1293, #1294, #1295, #1296, #1297, #1298, #1299

### 4. Verification
Confirmed all references to "todd" or "@toddself" removed from:
- All 10 issue bodies
- All 11 comments across the issues

## Technical Details

### GitHub API Commands Used

**Update comment** (direct field approach):
```bash
gh api --method PATCH repos/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server/issues/comments/{ID} \
  --field body='Updated text here'
```

**Update issue body** (file-based approach for longer content):
```bash
gh api --method PATCH repos/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server/issues/{NUMBER} \
  --field body=@/tmp/file.txt
```

### Lessons Learned

1. **File references in gh api**: Using `--field body=@filename` reads file content, but filename must be absolute or properly referenced
2. **Direct vs file approach**: Short text can use `--field body='text'`, longer content better via temp files
3. **Issue bodies vs comments**: Comments and issue bodies are separate entities requiring different API endpoints
4. **Verification is critical**: Always verify fixes before proceeding to batch operations

### Issues Encountered

1. **Initial syntax errors**: Tried using multiple arguments incorrectly
2. **Loop syntax**: ZSH syntax issues with for loops - had to break into individual commands
3. **Incomplete initial search**: Found comments first, missed issue bodies initially
4. **Token efficiency**: Multiple failed attempts wasted tokens - should validate syntax on single item first

## Key Learnings

1. **Test on one first**: When fixing multiple items, validate the approach on a single item before scaling
2. **Read error messages carefully**: "accepts 1 arg(s), received 2" clearly indicated syntax issue
3. **Separate concerns**: Issue bodies and comments are separate - need to check both
4. **Proper attribution matters**: External contributors deserve correct credit

## Contributor Attribution

**Todd Dibble** (@insomnolence): https://github.com/insomnolence
- Conducted security audit that identified issues #1290-1299
- Should be properly credited in all related issues

## Final Status

✅ All 10 issues (#1290-1299) now correctly reference @insomnolence
✅ All 11 comments across these issues updated
✅ No remaining references to @toddself in these issues
✅ Proper attribution to Todd Dibble for security audit work
