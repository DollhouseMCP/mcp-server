## Key Insights

### MCP Server Behavior
When running `npx @dollhousemcp/mcp-server`, the server starts and waits for MCP connections on stdio. This appears as a "hang" but is normal operation. For version verification, use:
```bash
node -e "const pkg = require('@dollhousemcp/mcp-server/package.json'); console.log(pkg.version)"
```

### PR Status Confusion
Initially thought PR #1143 needed to be closed, but it was already merged earlier today. Always verify PR status before attempting actions.
