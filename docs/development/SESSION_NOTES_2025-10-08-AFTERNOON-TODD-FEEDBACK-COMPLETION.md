   - Eliminates branch collision issues with multiple Claude Code sessions
   - Prepares infrastructure for multi-agent parallel workflows

2. **Gitignore Cleanup** (PR #1276 - MERGED)
   - Added `.obsidian/` to IDE files section
   - Added `test-results/` to test artifacts section
   - Both are user-specific/generated content

3. **Docs Archive Rename** (PR #1277 - MERGED)
   - Renamed `docs/archive/` → `docs/session-history/`
   - Eliminates confusion with root `archive/` (dev tools directory)

## Git Worktree Workflow

### Motivation

**Problem encountered during earlier session:**
- Terminal 1: Working on Docker feature branch
- Terminal 2: Claude Code opened, same branch context
- **Result**: Committed file to wrong branch

**Multi-agent future:**
- Planning for multiple Claude Code instances working simultaneously
- Dozen+ agents working on different features in parallel
- Need complete context isolation

### Solution: Git Worktrees

**Structure established:**
```
~/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/
├── mcp-server/              # Main repo (stays on develop)
└── worktrees/
    ├── todd-gitignore-cleanup/       # Feature work
    └── rename-docs-archive/          # Feature work
```

**Benefits:**
- Each directory = one branch (impossible to work on wrong branch)
- Parallel work without context switching
- Each Claude Code session can have its own worktree
- No stashing required
- Perfect isolation for multi-agent workflows

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Create worktree from main repo:**
   ```bash
   cd mcp-server
   git worktree add ../worktrees/feature-name -b feature/feature-name develop
   ```

2. **Work in worktree:**
   ```bash
   cd ../worktrees/feature-name
   # Make changes, commit, push
   ```

3. **After PR merge:**
   ```bash
   cd mcp-server
   git checkout develop && git pull
   git worktree remove ../worktrees/feature-name
   ```

**Known Issue:** GitFlow Guardian false positive when creating feature branches from develop (documented, expected behavior)

---

## PR #1276: Gitignore Cleanup

### Changes

Added two directories to `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# IDE files
.obsidian/

# Test results
test-results/
```

### Rationale

- **`.obsidian/`** - Personal Obsidian vault files (user-specific tool)
- **`test-results/`** - Generated test output files (Sep 19 last modified)

Both directories contain content that should not be tracked in version control.

### Process

- Created in worktree: `worktrees/todd-gitignore-cleanup/`
- GitFlow Guardian warning (expected false positive)
- Single focused commit
- Merged via squash to develop
- Worktree cleaned up

**Merged**: Commit `993128dc`

## PR #1277: Docs Archive Rename

### Problem: Naming Confusion

Two different "archive" directories with different purposes:

| Directory | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `archive/` (root) | Dev tools/scripts | Actively maintained by SonarCloud |
| `docs/archive/` | Historical session notes | Stale documentation >7 days old |

The word "archive" meant two different things, causing confusion.

### Solution

Renamed `docs/archive/` → `docs/session-history/`

**Result:**
- `archive/` = Development tools (clear purpose)
- `docs/session-history/` = Historical session notes (self-documenting)

### Changes Made

**1. Directory Rename**
- 224 archived files moved
- All YYYY/MM/ subdirectories preserved (2025/07/, 2025/09/)
- Git detected as rename (not delete+add)

**2. Scripts Updated (4 files)**
- `scripts/archive-old-docs.sh` - Updated `ARCHIVE_BASE="docs/session-history"`
- `scripts/smart-archive-docs.sh` - Updated `ARCHIVE_BASE="docs/session-history"`
- `scripts/fix-archived-references.sh` - Updated to dynamic path discovery
- `scripts/never-archive-list.txt` - No changes (filename-only list)

**3. Documentation Updated**
- `docs/development/ARCHIVING_GUIDELINES.md` - Complete path overhaul
- 8 additional files with archive references updated

**4. Script Improvement (2nd commit)**

**Issue found:** Hard-coded path in `fix-archived-references.sh`:
```bash
ARCHIVED_FILES=$(ls docs/session-history/2025/07/ | grep -E "\.md$")
```

**Fixed with dynamic discovery:**
```bash
declare -A ARCHIVED_PATHS
while IFS= read -r archive_file; do
    filename=$(basename "$archive_file")
    relative_path="${archive_file#$ARCHIVE_BASE/}"
    ARCHIVED_PATHS["$filename"]="$relative_path"
done < <(find "$ARCHIVE_BASE" -type f -name "*.md")
```

**Benefits:**
- Works with any YYYY/MM/ date structure
- No hard-coded paths
- Future-proof for new archives
- Uses associative array for filename → path mapping

### Escaping Observation

**Current implementation:**
```bash
sed -i.bak -E "s|\.\.?/+([^/]*/)*(${filename})|../${relative_path//\//\\/}|g" "$doc_file"
```

The `${relative_path//\//\\/}` escaping is complex because we're using `|` as the sed delimiter while the replacement contains forward slashes.

**Better approach (deferred):**
```bash
sed -i.bak -E "s#\.\.?/+([^/]*/)*(${filename})#../${relative_path}#g" "$doc_file"
```

Using `#` as delimiter eliminates escaping entirely.

**Decision:** Created Issue #1278 to add tests FIRST, then refactor escaping.

**Merged**: Commits `175a4739` and `6183908d`

## Issue #1278: Archive Script Testing

### Problem

No test coverage exists for:
- `scripts/archive-old-docs.sh`
- `scripts/smart-archive-docs.sh`
- `scripts/fix-archived-references.sh`

**Risk:** Changes to these scripts could break without detection.

### Solution (Two Phases)

**Phase 1: Add Tests (Required First)**
1. Set up test framework for bash scripts
2. Test `fix-archived-references.sh`:
   - Various reference format replacements
   - Multiple date directories
   - Nested paths
   - No-change scenarios
   - Special characters in paths
3. Test `archive-old-docs.sh` (mtime-based)
4. Test `smart-archive-docs.sh` (filename date parsing)

**Phase 2: Improve Escaping (After Tests Pass)**
5. Refactor sed commands to use `#` delimiter
6. Remove complex `${relative_path//\//\\/}` escaping
7. Verify all tests still pass

### Acceptance Criteria

- All three scripts have comprehensive test coverage
- Tests integrated into `npm test`
- Tests verify sed escaping works correctly
- Sed escaping simplified after tests prove it safe
- All existing functionality preserved

**Priority:** Medium - Scripts work now, but need safety net for future changes

## Technical Insights

### Git Worktree Benefits for Multi-Agent Development

**Current need:** Multiple Claude Code instances working simultaneously

**Worktree solution:**
- Each agent gets its own working directory
- Complete branch isolation
- No context switching overhead
- Impossible to commit to wrong branch
- Parallel development without conflicts

**Example setup for multi-agent:**
```
worktrees/
├── agent-1-feature-auth/      # Agent 1: Authentication work
├── agent-2-feature-api/       # Agent 2: API improvements
├── agent-3-fix-security/      # Agent 3: Security fixes
└── agent-4-docs-update/       # Agent 4: Documentation
```

Each agent works independently, no shared state, no merge conflicts during development.

### Dynamic Path Discovery Pattern

**Problem:** Hard-coded paths break as data evolves

**Solution:** Use `find` + associative arrays
```bash
declare -A PATHS_MAP
while IFS= read -r file; do
    key=$(basename "$file")
    value="${file#base/path/}"
    PATHS_MAP["$key"]="$value"
done < <(find base/path -type f -name "*.ext")
```

**Benefits:**
- Self-updating as new files are added
- No maintenance required
- Works with any directory structure
- Efficient lookups via associative array

### Sed Delimiter Choice

**Guideline:** Use delimiter that doesn't appear in replacement text

**Common delimiters:**
- `/` - Most common, but conflicts with file paths
- `|` - Better for file paths, but still needs escaping
- `#` - Best for file paths (no escaping needed)
- `@` - Alternative, but less readable

**Best practice:** Choose `#` for file path replacements to avoid all escaping.

## Key Learnings

### Git Worktrees Are Essential for Multi-Agent Workflows

The accidental wrong-branch commit from earlier sessions proved git worktrees aren't optional for parallel development - they're required for safety and correctness.

**Decision:** Standardize on worktree workflow going forward.

### Test Before Refactor

Found complex sed escaping during rename work. Instead of immediately "fixing" it:
1. Identified the issue
2. Created test requirement
3. Deferred refactor until tests exist

**Result:** Safety net prevents breaking changes, documents expected behavior.

### Hard-Coded Paths Are Technical Debt

The `2025/07/` hard-coded path would have broken the first time we archived files in a different month. Dynamic discovery eliminates entire class of bugs.

**Lesson:** Always prefer dynamic discovery over hard-coded paths for evolving data.

### Directory Names Should Be Self-Documenting

`docs/archive/` was ambiguous - archive of what? Old code? Test data? Session notes?

`docs/session-history/` is immediately clear - historical session documentation.

**Principle:** Directory names should answer "what's in here?" without needing documentation.

---

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate (If Desired)

1. **Tackle Issue #1278** (Add archiving script tests)
   - Set up bash testing framework
   - Write comprehensive tests
   - Simplify sed escaping

### Major Work (Future Session)

2. **`index.ts` Refactoring**
   - 6,028 lines of complex code
   - Todd's "stuff of nightmares" comment
   - Needs architectural planning
   - Break into smaller modules
   - Reduce complexity significantly

**Recommendation:** Complete script testing (#1278) before tackling index.ts refactor to build testing muscle and establish patterns.
