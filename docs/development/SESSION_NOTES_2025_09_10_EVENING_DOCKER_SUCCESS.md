# Session Notes - September 10, 2025 Evening - Docker Claude Code Integration Success

## Session Overview
**Time**: ~2:10 PM - 7:30 PM PST (5+ hours)  
**Branch**: `feature/docker-claude-code-testing`  
**Context**: Building Docker environment for testing DollhouseMCP with Claude Code  
**Result**: âœ… **COMPLETE SUCCESS** - PR #918 created and ready to merge  

## Starting Context

Earlier today, we successfully merged fixes for template rendering and portfolio sync. The user wanted to test these changes by running DollhouseMCP inside a Docker container alongside Claude Code. The goal was to create an isolated testing environment where both tools run together.

The user mentioned: "It is now possible to install Claude Code in a Docker container and run it from there" - they had figured this out earlier and wanted to document and implement it properly.

## Major Achievement: Complete Docker Testing Environment

We successfully created a fully functional Docker container that:
1. **Runs Claude Code CLI** (v1.0.110) inside the container
2. **Runs DollhouseMCP** (v1.7.3) in the same container
3. **Connects them via MCP protocol** with 29 tools available
4. **Handles authorization** for automated testing
5. **Provides complete documentation** for implementation

## The Journey: Key Discoveries and Solutions

### Phase 1: Research and Initial Setup (2:10 PM - 3:30 PM)

#### Web Search Discovery
- Found official npm package: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- Learned installation command: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@latest`
- Discovered multiple Docker approaches from community

#### Initial Docker Creation
Created `Dockerfile.claude-testing` with:
- Node.js 20-slim base
- Claude Code installation
- DollhouseMCP build from source
- MCP configuration in `/root/.config/claude-code/config.json`

### Phase 2: Build Challenges and Solutions (3:30 PM - 4:30 PM)

#### Challenge 1: TypeScript Build Failure
**Problem**: `tsc: not found` when building DollhouseMCP  
**Solution**: Changed from `npm ci --only=production` to `npm ci` to include dev dependencies

#### Challenge 2: MCP Connection Issues
**Problem**: Claude Code didn't detect MCP tools automatically  
**Discovery**: Must use `--mcp-config` flag explicitly!
```bash
claude --model sonnet --mcp-config /root/.config/claude-code/config.json
```

This was THE KEY DISCOVERY that made everything work!

### Phase 3: API Key and Testing (4:30 PM - 5:30 PM)

#### Setting Up API Key
User added `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to environment after I provided instructions:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-api03-..."
```

#### Successful MCP Tool Detection
With the correct configuration, Claude Code detected all 29 DollhouseMCP tools:
- Element management tools
- Portfolio operations
- Collection browsing
- GitHub integration
- And more!

### Phase 4: Authorization Solutions (5:30 PM - 6:30 PM)

#### The Permission Challenge
Claude Code requires permission to use MCP tools (security feature). We needed a way to handle this for automated testing.

#### Three Solutions Implemented

1. **Default Mode**: Interactive permission prompts (for manual testing)

2. **Pre-Approved Tools** (RECOMMENDED):
```bash
--allowedTools mcp__dollhousemcp__list_elements,mcp__dollhousemcp__get_build_info
```

3. **Dangerous Skip** (for sandboxes only):
```bash
--dangerously-skip-permissions
```

#### Non-Root User Implementation
Modified Dockerfile to run as `claude` user instead of root:
- Enables security features
- Allows --dangerously-skip-permissions if needed
- Better security practice

### Phase 5: Documentation and Tooling (6:30 PM - 7:30 PM)

Created comprehensive documentation suite and helper scripts to make testing easy.

## Files Created - Complete Documentation Suite

  - `--dangerous` - Skip all permissions
  - `--interactive` - Interactive mode

- **`scripts/test-claude-docker.sh`** - Interactive testing menu

## Critical Technical Details

### Working Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dollhousemcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/app/dollhousemcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "DOLLHOUSE_PORTFOLIO_DIR": "/app/portfolio",
        "DOLLHOUSE_CACHE_DIR": "/app/cache",
        "NODE_ENV": "development",
        "LOG_LEVEL": "debug"
      }
    }
  },
  "defaultMcpServer": "dollhousemcp"
}
```

### Key Commands That Work

#### Build Container
```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.claude-testing -t claude-dollhouse-test .
```

#### Run with MCP Tools (CRITICAL FLAGS)
```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  claude-dollhouse-test \
  claude --model sonnet --mcp-config /home/claude/.config/claude-code/config.json
```

#### Non-Interactive Testing (for CI/CD)
```bash
echo "List all personas" | docker run -i --rm \
  -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  claude-dollhouse-test \
  claude --model sonnet \
  --mcp-config /home/claude/.config/claude-code/config.json \
  --allowedTools mcp__dollhousemcp__list_elements
```

## Personal Notes

This was an incredibly productive session! We went from "I want to test in Docker" to a complete, documented, production-ready testing infrastructure in about 5 hours. 

Key success factors:
- User knew Claude Code could be installed in Docker
- Web search found the correct npm package
- Systematic problem-solving for each challenge
- Comprehensive documentation as we went
- Focus on both immediate use and future plans

The `--mcp-config` discovery was the breakthrough moment - without that flag, Claude Code doesn't load MCP servers from the config file, which explains why it wasn't working initially.

## Gratitude

Thank you for the acknowledgment of the hard work! This was a complex integration challenge that required:
- Research and discovery
- Problem-solving and debugging
- Security considerations
- Documentation excellence
- Future planning

Together we've created something that will benefit the DollhouseMCP project for a long time to come.

## Repository Status

- **Current Branch**: `feature/docker-claude-code-testing`
- **PR Created**: #918 to develop
- **Ready to Merge**: Yes
- **Documentation**: Complete
- **Testing**: Verified working

## Summary

We've successfully created a complete Docker-based testing environment for DollhouseMCP with Claude Code, including:
- Working Docker container with both tools
- Authorization solutions for automated testing
- Comprehensive documentation suite
- Helper scripts for easy use
- Full integration testing plan
- PR ready to merge

This provides the foundation for automated integration testing that will ensure DollhouseMCP always works correctly with Claude Code!
