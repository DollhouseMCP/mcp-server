# Session Notes - OBS Recording Manager Setup
**Date**: September 6, 2025 (Saturday, 11:11 AM - 12:45 PM)
**Focus**: Creating OBS recording system for DollhouseMCP demo videos
**Location**: `/Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/tools-internal/obs-recording-manager/`

## üéØ Objective
Create a comprehensive OBS recording management system using DollhouseMCP personas and skills to facilitate professional demo video creation with audio narration and automated scene management.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### 1. Created Directory Structure

### 2. DollhouseMCP Elements Created

#### Personas (2)
1. **OBS Director** - Expert streaming/recording director
   - Activated in DollhouseMCP system
   - Specializes in scene management, audio engineering, performance optimization
   - Key learning: Pronounce as "O B S" not "obs"

2. **Audio Narrator** - Voice feedback system
   - Uses macOS `say` command for TTS
   - Provides real-time status updates
   - Activated for accessibility and workflow feedback

#### Skills (4)
1. **obs-scene-configurator** - Scene creation and management
2. **scene-switcher** - Intelligent scene transitions
3. **audio-configurator** - Professional audio setup
4. **audio-narrator-skill** - Real-time narration

#### Templates (2)
1. **dollhouse-demo-template** - Complete 5-scene workflow
2. **quick-record-template** - Minimal setup for quick recordings

### 3. Technical Configuration

#### Hardware Detected
- **Camera**: Lumix via AVerMedia Live Gamer ULTRA S GC553Pro
  - Device ID: `UVC Camera VendorID_1994 ProductID_5459`
  - NOT using FaceTime camera or other devices
- **Audio**: Scarlett Solo USB interface (detected and configured)
- **Display**: 4K main display (3840x2160)

#### OBS Scene Collections Created
Three versions created, each improving on issues:

1. **DollhouseMCP_Demos.json** (v1)
   - Initial attempt, wrong camera device

2. **DollhouseMCP_Demos_v2.json** 
   - Updated camera references
   - Still had layout issues

3. **DollhouseMCP_Demos_v3.json** ‚úÖ CURRENT/WORKING
   - Correct device: `UVC Camera VendorID_1994 ProductID_5459`
   - Fixed layouts and positioning
   - 5 scenes with hotkeys (Cmd+1 through Cmd+5)
   - Located: `~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/basic/scenes/`

#### Five Configured Scenes
1. **1 - Introduction** - Full camera view
2. **2 - Main Demo** - Desktop + camera PIP (bottom-right)
3. **3 - Code Focus** - VS Code window
4. **4 - Claude Desktop** - Claude desktop app (NOT browser)
5. **5 - Split View** - Side-by-side Claude and VS Code

### 4. Key Scripts Created

#### obs-control.sh
Graceful OBS control with proper shutdown:
```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "OBS" to quit'  # Graceful quit
# NOT using killall OBS (causes issues)
```

#### Scene Installation Method
Direct copy to OBS folder (no import needed):
```bash
cp scene.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/obs-studio/basic/scenes/
# Then select from Scene Collection menu in OBS
```

### 5. Audio Configuration
- Noise suppression (RNNoise, 30%)
- Noise gate (-26dB open, -32dB close)
- Compressor (4:1 ratio, -18dB threshold)
- Output gain (+2dB)
- Saved to `~/obs-audio-config.json`

## üîß Current Status

### Working
- ‚úÖ OBS WebSocket enabled (port 4455)
- ‚úÖ Scene collection v3 installed and accessible
- ‚úÖ Audio narration via `say` command
- ‚úÖ Hotkeys configured (Cmd+1 through Cmd+5)

### Issues Encountered & Solutions
1. **Camera Issue**: CRITICAL - Device shows correctly but video doesn't work until you:
   - Select a different device in dropdown
   - Then reselect "Live Gamer ULTRA S GC553Pro"
   - This reinitializes the device and video appears
   - May need to use device name instead of Model ID in JSON
2. **Scene Collection Loading**: Collections don't auto-refresh; must select from menu
3. **Graceful Shutdown**: `killall OBS` causes problems; use AppleScript instead
4. **Device Naming**: Model ID alone may not be sufficient - needs investigation

### Pending WebSocket Integration
- WebSocket server running on port 4455
- Created `obs-websocket-control.py` and `obs-control.js`
- Need to install dependencies (`pip install websockets` or `npm install ws`)
- Once installed, can control OBS programmatically without restarts

## üìù Important Discoveries

### Key Learnings
1. **Scene collections stored in**: `~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/basic/scenes/`
2. **Direct file copy works** - No need to use OBS import function
3. **No restart needed** for scene collection changes (just select from menu)
4. **WebSocket is built into OBS 28+** (Tools ‚Üí WebSocket Server Settings)
5. **Pronunciation matters**: Say "O B S" not "obs"

### Updated Persona Knowledge
Both personas now know:
- Scene collections can be copied directly to OBS folder
- Use graceful shutdown with AppleScript
- Direct installation method (no import UI needed)

## üöÄ Next Session Tasks

### Immediate
1. Install WebSocket dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install ws  # For Node.js control
   # OR
   pip3 install websockets  # For Python control
   ```

2. Test WebSocket scene creation without UI

3. Fix camera PIP positioning in Scene 2 (may need manual adjustment)

### Future Enhancements
- Stream Deck integration
- Automated demo workflows
- Performance monitoring
- Multi-track audio recording

## üí° Quick Reference

### To Use System
```bash
cd /Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/tools-internal/obs-recording-manager

# Activate personas
dollhouse activate persona obs-director
dollhouse activate persona audio-narrator

# In OBS
Scene Collection ‚Üí DollhouseMCP_Demos_v3
# Then use Cmd+1 through Cmd+5 for scenes
```

### Recording Path
`~/Videos/DollhouseMCP_Demos/`

### Manual Fixes If Needed
- Camera not showing: Properties ‚Üí Device ‚Üí Select "Live Gamer ULTRA S GC553Pro"
- Claude app: Window Capture ‚Üí Owner: "Claude" (not browser)
- Audio: Scarlett Solo USB should be Mic/Aux input

## üìä Session Metrics
- Duration: ~1.5 hours
- Files created: 20+
- Personas activated: 2
- Skills created: 4
- Scene collections: 3 versions
- Final working version: v3

## üé¨ Ready for Recording!
System is functional and ready for demo video creation. Just need WebSocket libraries for full programmatic control.
