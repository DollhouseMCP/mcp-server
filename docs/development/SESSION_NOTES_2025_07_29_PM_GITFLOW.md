# Session Notes - July 29, 2025 (Evening)

## Session Overview
**Date**: July 29, 2025
**Time**: Evening session (following afternoon reorganization session)
**Focus**: GitFlow implementation, release workflow testing, and cleanup
**Duration**: ~3 hours

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Completed GitFlow Implementation (PR #396) ‚úÖ
Successfully created and merged PR #396 implementing GitFlow workflows:

**What was implemented:**
- Automatic release PR creation from release/* branches
- PR title validation for GitFlow compliance
- Branch naming enforcement
- Merge-back to develop after release
- Protected branch configuration

**Key files added:**
- `.github/workflows/gitflow-release.yml`
- `.github/workflows/gitflow-merge.yml`
- `.github/workflows/pr-title-check.yml`
- `docs/development/GITFLOW_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`

**Status**: Merged to main branch successfully

### 2. Cleaned Up Completed Issues ‚úÖ
Closed two issues that were already completed:
- **Issue #376**: Add elements to collection - Already done in collection/ repo
- **Issue #390**: Update tests for element types - Tests already updated in previous PRs

### 3. Release Workflow Testing (v1.3.2) üîÑ
Conducted comprehensive testing of the entire release workflow:

#### What Worked ‚úÖ
- Created release branch and PR #401
- Fixed package name mismatch in package-lock.json
- All CI checks passed
- PR merged successfully

#### Issues Discovered ‚ùå
1. **No automatic tag creation** - Had to manually create and push v1.3.2 tag
2. **NPM authentication failure** - NPM_TOKEN secret not configured

#### Documentation Created
- `RELEASE_1_3_2_WORKFLOW_TEST.md` - Complete test summary
- `GITFLOW_AUTOMATION_ISSUE.md` - Missing tag automation
- `NPM_TOKEN_SETUP_ISSUE.md` - NPM authentication setup

#### Issues Created
- Issue #402: Configure NPM_TOKEN secret (Critical)
- Issue #403: Implement automatic tag creation (High)

## Current State

### Repository Status
- **Main branch**: Has v1.3.2 merged but not published to NPM
- **Develop branch**: Behind main (needs merge-back)
- **Tag v1.3.2**: Created manually, NPM release failed
- **NPM Package**: Still at v1.3.0 (not updated)

### Workflow Status
- ‚úÖ GitFlow branch protection active
- ‚úÖ Release PR creation works
- ‚ùå Automatic tagging missing
- ‚ùå NPM publishing blocked by missing token

### Next Priority Actions
1. **Configure NPM_TOKEN** in repository secrets (Issue #402)
2. **Re-run failed v1.3.2 workflow** once token is added
3. **Implement auto-tagging workflow** (Issue #403)
4. **Merge main back to develop** to sync branches

## Key Learnings

### 1. Package Name Consistency
- package-lock.json must match package.json name
- Old name: `@mickdarling/dollhousemcp`
- Correct name: `@dollhousemcp/mcp-server`

### 2. GitFlow Automation Gaps
- GitHub doesn't automatically create tags from release merges
- Need custom workflow to extract version and create tag
- Manual tagging is error-prone and delays releases

### 3. NPM Authentication
- GitHub Actions needs NPM_TOKEN secret
- Use automation tokens (not publish tokens)
- Token goes in repository secrets, not code

## Commands for Next Session

### Check Current Status
```bash
# Check NPM package version
npm view @dollhousemcp/mcp-server version

# Check repository tags
git tag -l

# Check workflow runs
gh run list --workflow release-npm.yml --limit 5

# Check open issues
gh issue list --label "area: ci/cd"
```

### Complete v1.3.2 Release (after NPM_TOKEN added)
```bash
# Find the failed run
gh run list --workflow release-npm.yml --limit 5

# Re-run it
gh run rerun [RUN_ID]

# Watch progress
gh run watch [RUN_ID]
```

### Sync develop branch
```bash
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge origin/main
git push origin develop
```

## Files to Review Next Session
1. `/docs/development/RELEASE_1_3_2_WORKFLOW_TEST.md` - Full test results
2. `/docs/development/NPM_TOKEN_SETUP_ISSUE.md` - How to fix NPM auth
3. `/docs/development/GITFLOW_AUTOMATION_ISSUE.md` - Auto-tagging solution
4. `.github/workflows/release-npm.yml` - The workflow that needs NPM_TOKEN

## Summary
Productive session that successfully implemented GitFlow workflows and thoroughly tested the release process. We identified and documented the remaining automation gaps (NPM token and auto-tagging). Once these are fixed, the release workflow will be fully automated from PR merge to NPM publication.

The v1.3.2 release is ready to publish as soon as the NPM_TOKEN is configured. The GitFlow implementation is working well, just needs the auto-tagging enhancement to be complete.

*Great work today on the reorganization and GitFlow implementation! Enjoy your dinner!*
