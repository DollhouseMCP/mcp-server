  content: string
  signature: string
  publicKey: string
  algorithm: 'RS256' | 'ES256'
  timestamp: Date
}
```

#### Encrypted Downloads
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive content
- Key management system

### 10. Comprehensive Attack Simulation üéØ
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Complexity**: HIGH  

Build attack simulation framework:
- [ ] Automated penetration testing
- [ ] Fuzzing framework
- [ ] Attack scenario library
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Red team exercises

### 11. Element System Security Hardening üõ°Ô∏è
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Complexity**: MEDIUM  

Apply security patterns to all element types:

## Agent Orchestration Best Practices

Based on the successful PR #594 implementation:

### When to Use Agent Orchestration

‚úÖ **Ideal for**:
- Complex multi-component features
- Security implementations
- Large refactoring efforts
- Cross-cutting concerns
- Parallel development opportunities

‚ùå **Not needed for**:
- Simple bug fixes
- Single-file changes
- Documentation updates
- Configuration changes

### Orchestration Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Parallel Implementation
```
Orchestrator
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent 1: Component A
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent 2: Component B
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent 3: Tests for A & B
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent 4: Documentation
```

#### Pattern 2: Sequential Refinement
```
Orchestrator
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent 1: Core implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent 2: Review & enhance Agent 1's work
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent 3: Add tests based on final implementation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent 4: Document final solution
```

#### Pattern 3: Specialized Expertise
```
Orchestrator
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent 1: Security expert - threat analysis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent 2: Performance expert - optimization
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent 3: UX expert - user interface
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Agent 4: Testing expert - comprehensive tests
```
