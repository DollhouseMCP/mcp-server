# Security PR #209 - CodeQL Fixes

## Date: July 11, 2025

## Issues Identified
CodeQL static analysis identified potential security vulnerabilities in the enhanced security implementation.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) Prevention

**File**: `src/security/yamlValidator.ts`

**Problem**: Unbounded regex quantifiers could cause catastrophic backtracking
- Patterns like `[^>]*` and `[\s\S]*?` could process malicious input indefinitely
- Could lead to CPU exhaustion and denial of service

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Before: Unbounded patterns
.replace(/<script[^>]*>[\s\S]*?<\/script>/gi, '')

// After: Bounded patterns with limits
.replace(/<script[^>]{0,100}>[\s\S]{0,1000}?<\/script>/gi, '')
```

**Changes**:
- Added 10KB input length limit
- Bounded all quantifiers: `{0,100}` for attributes, `{0,1000}` for content
- Limited event handler name length: `\w{1,20}`
- Prevents catastrophic backtracking on malicious input

### 2. Promise Resolution Safety

**File**: `src/security/commandValidator.ts`

**Problem**: Multiple promise resolution attempts
- Timeout handler could reject after process already completed
- Could cause "Promise already resolved" errors
- Race condition between timeout and process completion

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Added completion tracking
let isCompleted = false;

const complete = (fn: () => void) => {
  if (!isCompleted) {
    isCompleted = true;
    if (timeoutHandle) {
      clearTimeout(timeoutHandle);
    }
    fn();
  }
};
```

**Changes**:
- Added `isCompleted` flag to track promise state
- Created `complete()` helper to ensure single resolution
- Proper cleanup of timeout in all code paths
- Prevents multiple resolve/reject calls

## Testing
- All security tests still passing
- TypeScript compilation successful
- No functional changes, only safety improvements

## Security Impact
These fixes prevent:
1. **DoS attacks** via malicious regex input
2. **Resource exhaustion** from unbounded patterns
3. **Promise rejection errors** in production
4. **Race conditions** in command execution

## Next Steps
- Monitor CodeQL results after push
- Verify all CI checks pass
- Merge PR once approved
