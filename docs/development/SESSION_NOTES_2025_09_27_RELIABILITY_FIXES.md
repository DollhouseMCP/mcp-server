### Reliability Progress
- Starting bugs: 55 (1 CRITICAL, 52 MAJOR, 2 MINOR)
- Fixed: 40 bugs (73%)
- Remaining: ~15 bugs
- Expected rating: D â†’ B (after PR #1155 merges)

## Technical Patterns Fixed

1. **Control Characters**: Unicode escape sequences
   - `\x00` â†’ `\u0000`
   - Applied to null bytes, control chars

2. **Regex Precedence**: Explicit grouping
   - `/^-|-$/` â†’ `/(^-)|(-$/`
   - Clarified alternation intent

3. **Error Handling**: No throw in finally
   - Prevents masking original errors
   - Better debugging experience

## Remaining Work (for next session)
- 5 unused object instantiations
- 2 duplicate conditionals
- 2 regex empty string matches
- ~6 miscellaneous issues

## Process Notes
- Sequential branch â†’ PR â†’ merge workflow
- Each PR focused on one bug category
- All changes backward compatible
- No functional changes, only clarity/safety

## Next Session Goals
- Complete remaining 15 bugs
- Achieve B reliability rating or better
- Begin v1.9.11 release preparation
