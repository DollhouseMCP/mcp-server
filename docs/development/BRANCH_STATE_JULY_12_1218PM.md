### Critical Note
The RegexValidator implementation is complete but **NOT YET TESTED**. The test file had one syntax error that was fixed (`.*+` â†’ `.*`), but full test suite hasn't been run yet.

### Ready for Next Session
All code changes are saved and ready. Just need to:
1. Run tests
2. Fix any issues
3. Commit and create PR

This represents ~2 hours of security work building on the morning's achievements.
