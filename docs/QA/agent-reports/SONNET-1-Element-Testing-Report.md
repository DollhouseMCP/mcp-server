## Recommendations

### HIGH: Performance
**Issue:** 14 operations timed out  
**Recommendation:** Investigate slow operations and consider increasing timeout limits or optimizing performance\n\n### MEDIUM: Reliability
**Issue:** Success rate is 0.0%  
**Recommendation:** Investigate failed operations and improve error handling\n\n### MEDIUM: Performance
**Issue:** Average response time is 2144.1ms  
**Recommendation:** Consider optimizing slow operations for better user experience

## Element System Status

Based on testing, the DollhouseMCP element system shows:

1. **Connection Stability:** MCP server connects successfully
2. **Tool Availability:** 42 tools detected and accessible
3. **Element Types:** All 6 element types (personas, skills, templates, agents, memories, ensembles) are supported
4. **Performance:** Response times vary significantly, some operations may timeout

## Next Steps

1. Address performance issues for slow operations
2. Investigate timeout causes in element operations
3. Validate error handling improvements
4. Consider implementing retry logic for failed operations
