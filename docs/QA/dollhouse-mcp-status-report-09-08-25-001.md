# Dollhouse MCP Status Report
*Generated: September 8, 2025*

## System Overview

**Dollhouse MCP Version:** 1.7.2  
**Runtime:** Node.js v24.1.0 on macOS ARM64  
**User:** mickdarling  
**Status:** Operational with Issues

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### Core System
- **MCP Connection**: ‚úÖ Connected and stable
- **Configuration Management**: ‚úÖ Working properly
- **User Profile**: ‚úÖ Successfully configured (username: mickdarling)
- **Sync Enabled**: ‚úÖ Successfully enabled sync functionality

### Local Portfolio Access
- **File System Access**: ‚úÖ Full access to `/Users/mick/.dollhouse/portfolio`
- **Local Element Discovery**: ‚úÖ Properly reading all element types
- **Local Portfolio Structure**: ‚úÖ Complete and well-organized

#### Local Portfolio Inventory
- **Personas**: ~45 files ‚úÖ
- **Skills**: 60+ files ‚úÖ  
- **Templates**: 35+ files ‚úÖ
- **Agents**: 24+ files ‚úÖ
- **Ensembles**: 4 files ‚úÖ
- **Memories**: 3 files ‚úÖ

### Configuration Settings
- **Privacy Scanning**: ‚úÖ Enabled for secrets and PII
- **Individual Sync**: ‚úÖ Configured with confirmation and diff preview
- **Authentication**: ‚úÖ OAuth enabled
- **Element Directory**: ‚úÖ Properly set to local portfolio path

## ‚ùå Critical Issues

### 1. **GitHub Remote Portfolio Listing - BROKEN**

**Problem**: The `list-remote` operation only returns personas (231 items), completely missing other element types.

**Expected Behavior**: Should return all element types (skills, templates, agents, ensembles, memories) from GitHub repository.

**Current Behavior**: 
```
Found 231 elements:
**personas** (231): [shows all personas]
[NO OTHER ELEMENT TYPES DISPLAYED]
```

**Impact**: 
- Cannot verify GitHub repository contents
- Cannot identify sync discrepancies
- Potential data loss risk if other elements aren't actually synced

**Attempted Fixes**:
- ‚úÖ Tried filtering by element type (`{"type": "skills"}`)
- ‚úÖ Tried including private elements (`{"include_private": true}`)
- ‚úÖ Verified sync is enabled
- ‚ùå All attempts return same result (personas only)

### 2. **Element Type Filtering - NOT WORKING**

**Problem**: When filtering `list-remote` by element type, it still returns all personas instead of the requested element type.

**Test Case**: 
```
sync_portfolio operation: "list-remote", filter: {"type": "skills"}
Result: Returns all 231 personas instead of skills
```

### 3. **Compare Operation - DISABLED**

**Problem**: Cannot compare individual elements between local and remote.

**Error**: "Sync is Disabled - Portfolio sync is currently disabled for privacy"

**Note**: This occurs even though sync is enabled in configuration (`sync.enabled: true`)

## üîç Investigation Needed

### Questions for Developer

1. **Is the GitHub repository structure correct?** 
   - Are skills/templates/agents/ensembles/memories actually in the remote repository?
   - What's the expected directory structure on GitHub?

2. **Is there a known bug in v1.7.2's `list-remote` functionality?**
   - Does it properly scan all element type directories?
   - Are there any known filtering issues?

3. **Why does compare operation report "sync disabled" when sync.enabled = true?**
   - Is there a separate privacy setting affecting compare operations?
   - Are there additional permissions needed?

4. **What's the expected behavior for bulk operations?**
   - Should `bulk-download` and `bulk-upload` work with current configuration?
   - Are there prerequisites we're missing?

## üß™ Suggested Tests

### Test 1: Manual GitHub Repository Verification
- Developer should manually check GitHub repository structure
- Verify all element types are present and properly organized
- Compare against local portfolio structure

### Test 2: List-Remote Debugging
- Add debug logging to `list-remote` operation
- Verify it's scanning all expected directories
- Check if element type filtering is functioning

### Test 3: Compare Operation Investigation
- Identify why compare reports sync as disabled
- Test with minimal element to isolate the issue
- Verify privacy settings aren't blocking operation

### Test 4: Alternative Listing Method
- Test if there's an alternative way to list remote elements
- Consider implementing per-element-type listing
- Verify GitHub API connectivity and permissions

## üìä Configuration Details

```yaml
user:
  username: mickdarling
  email: null
  display_name: null

github:
  portfolio:
    repository_url: null
    repository_name: dollhouse-portfolio
    default_branch: main
    auto_create: true
  auth:
    use_oauth: true
    token_source: environment

sync:
  enabled: true
  individual:
    require_confirmation: true
    show_diff_before_sync: true
    track_versions: true
    keep_history: 10
  bulk:
    upload_enabled: false
    download_enabled: false
    require_preview: true
    respect_local_only: true
  privacy:
    scan_for_secrets: true
    scan_for_pii: true
    warn_on_sensitive: true

collection:
  auto_submit: false
  require_review: true
  add_attribution: true

elements:
  default_element_dir: /Users/mick/.dollhouse/portfolio
```

## üéØ Priority Actions

1. **HIGH**: Fix `list-remote` to show all element types, not just personas
2. **HIGH**: Fix element type filtering in `list-remote` operations
3. **MEDIUM**: Resolve compare operation "sync disabled" error
4. **MEDIUM**: Enable and test bulk operations
5. **LOW**: Add repository_url to configuration once GitHub sync is verified

## üí° Notes

- User (mickdarling) has a substantial local portfolio that appears well-organized
- Most test personas in GitHub listing suggest extensive QA testing has occurred
- The abundance of test entries (timestamps in filenames) indicates active development/testing
- Local portfolio is significantly more diverse than what GitHub listing shows
