Hi there, I'd like to see all of the dollhouse elements I have in my portfolio here on my computer.

I'll help you see all the dollhouse elements in your local portfolio. Let me check what elements you have available across all types.

I'd like to upload the Jarvis persona to my repository on GitHub. Can we do that?

Edit
Absolutely! I can help you upload the J.A.R.V.I.S. persona to your GitHub repository. Let me first check your GitHub authentication status and then we can sync it to your portfolio.

check_github_auth


Great! You're already connected to GitHub as mickdarling. Now let me check your portfolio status:


D

portfolio_status


Perfect! You already have a GitHub portfolio repository set up. Now let's sync your J.A.R.V.I.S. persona (along with any other local changes) to your GitHub repository:


D

sync_portfolio


It seems there might be a sync issue. Let me check if we need to re-initialize the portfolio connection:


D

init_portfolio


Now let's try the sync again:


D

sync_portfolio


Let me check the portfolio configuration:


D

portfolio_config


There seems to be a configuration issue. Let me try to force a dry run sync to see what's happening:


D

sync_portfolio


Great! The dry run shows everything is ready. Let me perform the actual sync:


D

sync_portfolio


It seems there's a persistent issue with the portfolio sync. Let me try a different approach and check if we can search for the J.A.R.V.I.S. persona specifically to ensure it's ready:


D

get_element_details


I can see the J.A.R.V.I.S. persona is ready in your local portfolio. The sync issue seems to be a technical problem with the portfolio connection. Let me try an alternative approach by checking if there's a configuration issue we can resolve:


D

portfolio_config


Let me check the file system to see if there are any portfolio-related configuration files:

F


list_allowed_directories


F


search_files


It looks like there might be a version or configuration issue with the current DollhouseMCP setup. While we troubleshoot the sync issue, let me show you an alternative approach. Since your GitHub repository exists, I can show you exactly what the J.A.R.V.I.S. persona contains so you could manually add it if needed:

The J.A.R.V.I.S. persona is a sophisticated AI butler with British wit and dry sarcasm, inspired by Tony Stark's digital assistant. It's already in your local portfolio and ready to be synced once we resolve the technical issue.

For now, here are a few options:

Wait for the sync issue to be resolved - This seems to be a technical issue with the portfolio connection that might need attention from the DollhouseMCP development team.
Manual upload - Since you have GitHub access, you could manually create the persona file in your repository at https://github.com/mickdarling/dollhouse-portfolio
Try submission to the community collection - This might work independently of the portfolio sync:

submit_content


Let me try with the exact filename:


D

submit_content


Excellent! The J.A.R.V.I.S. persona has been successfully uploaded to your GitHub repository!

ðŸŽ‰ Success! Your J.A.R.V.I.S. persona is now available at: Repository: https://github.com/mickdarling/dollhouse-portfolio
Direct commit: https://github.com/mickdarling/dollhouse-portfolio/commit/e2db3d2cb8d9a56a444a7f280fe89c98e12b6237

The persona includes:

Sophisticated British butler personality
Dry wit and refined sarcasm
Unwavering loyalty and helpfulness
Polite condescension and gentle humor
Would you like me to also submit this persona to the community collection so others can discover and use it? Or would you prefer to upload any other personas from your extensive collection?
