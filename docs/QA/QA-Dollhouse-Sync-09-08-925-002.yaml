The system appears to be in a fresh state without user configuration. Would you like me to help you set up your user identity or configure any specific settings?

Enable sync and update the user ID to Mick Darling, all one word lowercase.

I'll enable sync and update your user identity to "mickdarling". Let me make those configuration changes:

Perfect! I've successfully:

Enabled sync - You can now sync elements between your local portfolio and GitHub
Set your username to "mickdarling"
Your Dollhouse MCP is now configured with sync capabilities enabled and your user identity set. You can now perform sync operations like uploading elements to GitHub, downloading from your portfolio repository, and managing your AI customization elements across platforms.

Would you like me to help you set up GitHub authentication or configure any other settings?

Alright, list the elements in the dollhouse portfolio, my personal dollhouse portfolio on github please.

I'll list the elements in your personal Dollhouse portfolio on GitHub. Let me check what's available in your remote repository:

Your GitHub Dollhouse portfolio contains 231 personas! It looks like you have quite an extensive collection. I can see several interesting ones mixed in with what appears to be a lot of test personas:

Notable personas include:

aria 7
asimov assistant
code review companion
dollhouse expert
executive assistant pro
git flow master
j a r v i s
reddit expert
reddit karma farmer
screenwriting suite 01 professional screenwriter
screenwriting suite 02 tv development assistant
travel planner
verbose victorian scholar
The majority appear to be test personas (with names like "test qa null commit test" and "test qa public persona" followed by timestamps), which suggests this repository has been used for testing and development.

Would you like me to show you details about any specific persona, or would you prefer to see what elements you have locally in your portfolio directory?

There should be other element types. Can you check those please?

You're absolutely right! Let me check for other element types in your GitHub portfolio. The previous command only showed personas, but there should be skills, templates, agents, memories, and ensembles as well.
