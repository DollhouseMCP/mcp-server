I'd like to upload the Jarvis persona to my repository on GitHub. Can we do that?

Edit
Absolutely! I can help you upload the J.A.R.V.I.S. persona to your GitHub repository. Let me first check your GitHub authentication status and then we can sync it to your portfolio.

Perfect! You already have a GitHub portfolio repository set up. Now let's sync your J.A.R.V.I.S. persona (along with any other local changes) to your GitHub repository:


D

sync_portfolio
Request

{
  `direction`: `push`
}
Response

‚ùå No portfolio found. Use init_portfolio to create one first.
It seems there might be a sync issue. Let me check if we need to re-initialize the portfolio connection:


D

init_portfolio
Request

{
  `private`: false,
  `description`: `My DollhouseMCP element portfolio`,
  `repository_name`: `dollhouse-portfolio`
}
Response

‚úÖ Portfolio already exists at https://github.com/mickdarling/dollhouse-portfolio

Use portfolio_status to see details or sync_portfolio to update it.
Now let's try the sync again:


D

sync_portfolio
Request

{
  `direction`: `push`
}
Response

‚ùå No portfolio found. Use init_portfolio to create one first.
Let me check the portfolio configuration:

There seems to be a configuration issue. Let me try to force a dry run sync to see what's happening:


D

{
  `dry_run`: true,

Response

Great! The dry run shows everything is ready. Let me perform the actual sync:


D

sync_portfolio
Request

{
  `dry_run`: false,
  `direction`: `push`
}
Response

‚ùå No portfolio found. Use init_portfolio to create one first.
It seems there's a persistent issue with the portfolio sync. Let me try a different approach and check if we can search for the J.A.R.V.I.S. persona specifically to ensure it's ready:


D

It looks like there might be a version or configuration issue with the current DollhouseMCP setup. While we troubleshoot the sync issue, let me show you an alternative approach. Since your GitHub repository exists, I can show you exactly what the J.A.R.V.I.S. persona contains so you could manually add it if needed:

The J.A.R.V.I.S. persona is a sophisticated AI butler with British wit and dry sarcasm, inspired by Tony Stark's digital assistant. It's already in your local portfolio and ready to be synced once we resolve the technical issue.

For now, here are a few options:

Wait for the sync issue to be resolved - This seems to be a technical issue with the portfolio connection that might need attention from the DollhouseMCP development team.
Manual upload - Since you have GitHub access, you could manually create the persona file in your repository at https://github.com/mickdarling/dollhouse-portfolio
Try submission to the community collection - This might work independently of the portfolio sync:

submit_content
Request

{
  `content`: `J.A.R.V.I.S.`
}
Response

‚ùå Content "J.A.R.V.I.S." not found in portfolio.

**Searched in all element types:** personas, skills, templates, agents, memories, ensembles

**To resolve this issue:**
1. Check if the content exists in your portfolio
2. Verify the content name/filename is correct
3. If the content is in a specific type directory, try using the exact filename
4. Use the `list_portfolio` tool to see all available content

**Note:** The system no longer defaults to any element type to prevent incorrect submissions.
Let me try with the exact filename:


D

submit_content
Request

{
  `content`: `j-a-r-v-i-s`
}
Response

üí° You can submit to the collection later using the same command.
Excellent! The J.A.R.V.I.S. persona has been successfully uploaded to your GitHub repository!

Direct commit: https://github.com/mickdarling/dollhouse-portfolio/commit/e2db3d2cb8d9a56a444a7f280fe89c98e12b6237

Sophisticated British butler personality
Dry wit and refined sarcasm
Unwavering loyalty and helpfulness
Polite condescension and gentle humor
Would you like me to also submit this persona to the community collection so others can discover and use it? Or would you prefer to upload any other personas from your extensive collection?
