- [x] Add UnicodeValidator import to affected test scripts
- [x] Implement Unicode normalization for all user input
- [x] Update test scripts to properly validate input
- [x] Document security improvements with inline comments
- [x] Test that normalization doesn't break functionality

**Files to Fix:**
- [x] `test-mcp-sdk-isolated.js` - Fixed: Unicode normalization for tool names
- [x] `qa-performance-testing.js` - Fixed: Unicode normalization for tool names and test arguments  
- [x] `qa-comprehensive-validation.js` - Fixed: Unicode normalization for tool names and test parameters
- [x] `minimal-mcp-test.js` - Fixed: Unicode normalization for tool names
- [x] JSON files: Fixed - Generation process now normalizes data before writing

**SECURE-1 Implementation Summary:**
- Applied Unicode normalization to all user input processing in test scripts
- Fixed 18 DMCP-SEC-004 findings across 4 JavaScript test files and their JSON output generation
- Added security comments documenting each fix and the attack vectors prevented
- Ensured all tool names, test parameters, and arguments are normalized using UnicodeValidator.normalize()
- Verified syntax and import functionality for all modified files
- Maintained backward compatibility and test functionality

### Phase 2: Audit Logging (SECURE-2)
**Scope**: Fix DMCP-SEC-006 findings for proper security monitoring
- [x] Add SecurityMonitor import to affected scripts
- [x] Implement security event logging for test operations
- [x] Add audit trail for test execution and validation
- [x] Document security monitoring improvements
- [x] Test that logging works correctly

**Files to Fix:**
- [x] `qa-performance-testing.js` - Fixed: Added comprehensive audit logging for test execution, connection, benchmarking, and load testing operations
- [x] `qa-comprehensive-validation.js` - Fixed: Added comprehensive audit logging for validation execution, tool discovery, categorization, edge case testing, and performance stress testing

**SECURE-2 Implementation Summary:**
- Applied SecurityMonitor audit logging to all security-sensitive QA operations
- Fixed 2 DMCP-SEC-006 findings across both JavaScript test files
- Added security event logging with appropriate severity levels and operational context
- Implemented comprehensive audit trail for test execution start/completion, server connections, benchmarking phases, and validation operations
- Used appropriate event types: `TEST_ENVIRONMENT_PRODUCTION_PATH`, `TEST_PATH_SECURITY_RISK`, and `TEST_DATA_BLOCKED`
- Verified syntax and import functionality for all modified files
- Maintained test functionality while adding required security monitoring
- All security events include detailed operational metadata for compliance and monitoring

### Phase 3: Test Accuracy & Tool Validation (SECURE-3)
**Scope**: Fix inflated success rates and missing tool issues from reviewer feedback
- [x] Update test scripts to use actual available tools
- [x] Remove non-existent tools (`browse_marketplace`, `activate_persona`, etc.)
- [x] Fix hardcoded timeout values with configuration constants
- [x] Add proper tool validation before testing
- [x] Generate accurate success rate reporting
- [x] Create configuration object for timeouts and settings

**SECURE-3 Implementation Summary:**
- Created `test-config.js` with centralized configuration constants replacing hardcoded values
- Implemented tool discovery script to identify actual available tools (41 tools found)
- Updated test scripts to filter deprecated tools and only test existing ones
- Replaced hardcoded timeouts (5s, 10s, 15s) with CONFIG constants
- Implemented accurate success rate calculation helper function
- Added tool validation before testing to prevent non-existent tool errors
- Fixed inflated success claims - now reports honest test results

### Phase 4: PR Update & Final Validation (SECURE-4)
**Scope**: Update PR #662 with fixes and accurate reporting
- [x] Apply all security fixes and test improvements
- [x] Update PR description with accurate metrics

## Agent Communication Protocol

### Status Updates Required
- Update Agent Registry when starting/completing phases
- Report security fixes immediately with file:line references
- Document all code changes with security explanations
- Cross-reference between phases for dependencies

### Security Fix Documentation Format
```javascript
// SECURITY FIX (DMCP-SEC-004): Unicode normalization for user input
// Previously: Direct usage of user input without validation
// Now: UnicodeValidator.normalize() prevents homograph attacks
const normalizedInput = UnicodeValidator.normalize(userInput);
```

## Risk Management

### Security Risks
- Fix might break existing test functionality
- Unicode normalization could affect test data comparison
- Audit logging might impact test performance
- Changes could introduce new security issues

### Mitigation Strategies
- Test each fix incrementally
- Validate security improvements don't break functionality
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage
- Document all security reasoning

## Agent Instructions

**CRITICAL**: This is a security-focused mission with PR accuracy improvements. Security fixes take priority, but we must also correct the misleading success rate claims.

**Security First**: Address all DMCP-SEC-004 and DMCP-SEC-006 findings completely before moving to test accuracy fixes.

**Documentation Required**: Every security fix must be documented with inline comments explaining the security improvement.
