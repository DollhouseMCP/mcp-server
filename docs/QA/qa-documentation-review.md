## Verification Results Summary

### Successfully Verified Claims
| Claim | Section | Verification Method | Source | Confidence |
|-------|---------|-------------------|---------|------------|
| 49 total tools available | Executive Summary | Systematic enumeration | Function analysis | High |
| DollhouseMCP v1.5.1 | Test Environment | Direct system query | System information | High |
| GitHub auth requirement for search | Detailed Results | Error reproduction | search_collection test | High |
| Git v2.39.5 dependency warning | System Status | Server status verification | System status output | High |
| Pass/fail statistics accuracy | Executive Summary | Mathematical validation | Statistical calculation | High |

### Unverified Claims
| Claim | Section | Reason | Recommendation |
|-------|---------|--------|----------------|
| Specific response times (45ms, 120ms, etc.) | Performance Analysis | Limited actual measurement | Add disclaimer about estimated timing |
| "100% of available tools tested" | Test Coverage | Some tools may have limited testing | Clarify depth of testing performed |
| Development time estimates | Developer Report | No verification methodology provided | Mark as professional estimates |

### Contradicted Claims
*No contradicted claims identified*

---

## Review Limitations

**Scope Limitations:**
- Could not verify all 49 tools individually due to time constraints
- Some advanced testing scenarios not reproducible in review environment
- Limited access to historical testing data for verification

**Verification Limitations:**
- Performance timing claims difficult to independently verify
- Some testing depth claims rely on inference from evidence
- Development cost/time estimates inherently unverifiable

**Temporal Limitations:**
- System state may have changed since original testing (persona count increased)
- Some claims are time-sensitive and may become outdated
- Dependency status subject to change

---

## Next Steps

**For Document Authors:**
1. Add testing limitations section to primary QA report
2. Clarify evidence basis for performance claims
3. Add confidence indicators for different types of claims
4. Include more specific timestamps and evidence citations

**For Review Process:**
1. Develop standardized evidence requirements for QA reports
2. Create verification checklist for technical documentation
3. Establish review criteria for different claim types

**Follow-up Required:**
- [ ] Re-review after limitation disclosures added
- [ ] Verification of development solution code against actual system
- [ ] Assessment of report usefulness after implementation begins
