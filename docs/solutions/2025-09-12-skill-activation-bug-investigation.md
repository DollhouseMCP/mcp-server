## Problem Statement

### Error/Issue
```
❌ Failed to activate skills 'verified-solutions-documenter': An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.
```

### When This Occurs
- Creating new skills after September 3, 2025
- Skills that previously worked stop working after editing
- Bulk skill creation fails for all new skills

## Root Cause Discovery

### Investigation Summary
Through systematic testing with 7 different variants, we discovered that skills REQUIRE proper semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format) to activate.

## Systematic Test Results

### Test Environment
- MCP Server Version: 1.7.1
- Test Date: September 12, 2025
- Process Count: 1 MCP server (PID 43325) - no orphans confirmed

### Control Group - Known Working Skill
**File**: `test-skill.md` (created Sept 11)
- **Name**: `Test Skill`
- **Version**: `2.1.0` ✅
- **Author**: Not present
- **Tags**: `[]`
- **Languages**: `[]`
- **Domains**: `[]`
- **Result**: ✅ ACTIVATES SUCCESSFULLY

### Test Variants Created

#### 1. Adding Author Field Test
**Change**: Added `author: mickdarling` to working skill
- **Version**: `2.1.0`
- **Result**: ✅ STILL WORKS
- **Conclusion**: Author field does NOT cause failure

#### 2. Minimal Content Test
**File**: `failure-mode-minimal.md`
- **Name**: `Failure Mode Minimal`
- **Version**: `2.1.0`
- **Content**: Simple "Hello World" text only
- **Result**: ✅ WORKS
- **Conclusion**: Content complexity is NOT the issue

#### 3. Bash Commands Test
**File**: `failure-mode-bash-commands.md`
- **Name**: `Failure Mode Bash Commands`
- **Version**: `2.1.0`
- **Content**: Multiple bash code blocks with system commands
- **Result**: ✅ WORKS
- **Conclusion**: Bash commands do NOT cause failure

#### 4. Full Content Test
**File**: `failure-mode-full-content.md`
- **Name**: `Failure Mode Full Content`
- **Version**: `2.1.0`
- **Content**: Complete verified-solutions-documenter content (8KB)
- **Result**: ✅ WORKS
- **Conclusion**: Content size/complexity is NOT the issue

### Fixing the Broken Skill - Step by Step

#### Original State (BROKEN)
```yaml
name: verified-solutions-documenter
description: >-
  Comprehensive documentation skill...
author: mickdarling
version: '1.1'
created: '2025-09-11T22:53:46.766Z'
modified: '2025-09-11T22:53:46.766Z'
tags:
  - documentation
  - solutions
  - verification
  - reproducibility
  - debugging
```
**Result**: ❌ FAILS TO ACTIVATE

#### Test 1: Change Name Format
**Change**: `name: verified-solutions-documenter` → `name: Verified Solutions Documenter`
**Result**: ❌ STILL FAILS
**Conclusion**: Hyphenated names are fine

#### Test 2: Unquote Version
**Change**: `version: '1.1'` → `version: 1.1`
**Result**: ❌ STILL FAILS
**Conclusion**: Quotes don't matter

#### Test 3: Change Dates
**Change**: Updated created/modified timestamps
**Result**: ❌ STILL FAILS
**Conclusion**: Dates don't matter

#### Test 4: Empty Tags Array
**Change**: `tags: [documentation, solutions, ...]` → `tags: []`
**Result**: ❌ STILL FAILS
**Conclusion**: Tags don't matter

#### Test 5: Remove Author Field
**Change**: Removed `author: mickdarling` line entirely
**Result**: ❌ STILL FAILS
**Conclusion**: Author field doesn't matter

#### Test 6: Simplify Description
**Change**: Multi-line `>-` description → Single line description
**Result**: ❌ STILL FAILS
**Conclusion**: Description format doesn't matter

#### Test 7: Fix Version Format ⭐
**Change**: `version: 1.1` → `version: 2.1.0`
**Result**: ✅ WORKS IMMEDIATELY!
**Conclusion**: THIS IS THE FIX!

## Verification Matrix

| Field | Original (Broken) | Working Version | Matters? |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|----------|
| name | hyphenated | Either format | ❌ No |
| description | Multi-line `>-` | Either format | ❌ No |
| author | mickdarling | Present or absent | ❌ No |
| **version** | **1.1** | **2.1.0** | **✅ YES!** |
| created/modified | Any date | Any date | ❌ No |
| tags | Populated or empty | Either | ❌ No |
| languages | Empty array | Either | ❌ No |
| domains | Empty array | Either | ❌ No |
| content | Any content | Any content | ❌ No |
| bash commands | Present | Present or absent | ❌ No |

## The Solution

### Required Version Format
Skills MUST use semantic versioning with all three components:
```yaml
version: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

### Examples
```yaml
# ✅ CORRECT - Will activate
version: 1.0.0
version: 2.1.0
version: 1.0.7
version: 10.2.5

# ❌ INCORRECT - Will fail with "unexpected error"
version: 1.0      # Missing patch version
version: 1.1      # Missing patch version
version: '1.1'    # Missing patch version (quotes don't help)
version: 1        # Missing minor and patch
```

## Working Solution

### To Fix Any Broken Skill
1. Open the skill file
2. Find the `version:` line in YAML frontmatter
3. Ensure it has three numbers separated by dots
4. If it shows `version: 1.0`, change to `version: 1.0.0`
5. Save file
6. Reload skills in MCP
7. Skill will now activate

### Quick Fix Command
```bash
# Fix a specific skill
sed -i '' 's/^version: \([0-9]\+\)\.\([0-9]\+\)$/version: \1.\2.0/' /Users/mick/.dollhouse/portfolio/skills/skillname.md

# Fix all skills missing patch version
for file in /Users/mick/.dollhouse/portfolio/skills/*.md; do
  sed -i '' 's/^version: \([0-9]\+\)\.\([0-9]\+\)$/version: \1.\2.0/' "$file"
done
```

## What DOESN'T Work

### Failed Theories Tested
1. ❌ **Markdown corruption theory** - Headers merging with content was a red herring
2. ❌ **Author field theory** - Works with or without author field
3. ❌ **Content blocking theory** - Bash commands and file paths are fine
4. ❌ **Date format theory** - Any valid ISO date works
5. ❌ **Name format theory** - Hyphens vs spaces doesn't matter
6. ❌ **Empty arrays theory** - languages/domains can be empty or populated

## Debug Journey

### Initial Hypothesis
We thought the markdown corruption (headers concatenated with content) was preventing skill parsing.

### Investigation Path
1. Manually fixed markdown - Still failed
2. Compared working vs non-working skills - Found metadata differences
3. Created 7 systematic test variants - Isolated variables
4. Modified known-working skill - Added suspected problem fields one by one
5. Modified broken skill - Changed fields to match working format
6. Discovered version format was the ONLY difference that mattered

### Root Cause
MCP server v1.7.1 has strict semantic versioning validation that requires MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format. Skills created with abbreviated versions (1.0 or 1.1) fail validation and throw a generic "unexpected error".

- Original discovery: September 11, 2025 evening session

### Why This Wasn't Obvious
1. Error message is generic ("unexpected error") - doesn't mention version
2. Old skills from Sept 3 had proper versions, so they worked
3. Markdown corruption happened to coincide, creating false correlation
4. Multiple differences between working/broken skills obscured root cause

### Future Improvements
- [ ] MCP server should provide specific error: "Invalid version format"
- [ ] Skill creation should enforce semantic versioning
- [ ] Documentation should specify version requirements
