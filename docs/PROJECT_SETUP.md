2. **Choose Template**
   - Select "Team planning" template (recommended)

### Board View Setup
Create columns:
```
üìã Backlog | üîç Triage | üìÖ Ready | üöß In Progress | üëÄ In Review | ‚úÖ Done
```

### Table View Fields
Add custom fields:

- **Area**: Single select (Docker, Testing, Platform, Marketplace, UX, Security)
- **Effort**: Single select (XS, S, M, L, XL)
- **Sprint**: Iteration field
- **Milestone**: Milestone field (link to repo milestones)

## Linking Existing Issues

We've created a script to add all issues to your project. Run:

```bash
# Run the interactive script
./scripts/add-issues-to-project.sh

# The script will:
# 1. Ask for your project number (from the URL)
# 2. Find all open issues
# 3. Add them to your project board
# 4. Show a summary of results
```

**Alternative manual method:**
1. Go to your project board
2. Click "+ Add item" 
3. Search for issues to add
4. Or drag issues from the repository issues page

## Automation Rules

In your project settings, add these automation rules:

### Item Added to Project
- Set status to "Backlog"

### Item Closed
- Set status to "Done"

### Pull Request Merged
- Set status to "Done"

### Label Added
When label "priority: critical" is added ‚Üí Move to "Ready"
When label "status: in-progress" is added ‚Üí Move to "In Progress"

## Workflow Integration

Note: The project automation workflow has been removed from this repository as it was misplaced. 
For element submission automation, see the collection repository's workflow at:
`.github/workflows/project-integration.yml`

Manual project management can be done through GitHub's built-in project automation rules.
