# Release Notes - v1.9.16

**Release Date**: October 3, 2025
**Type**: Patch Release
**Focus**: Platform-Agnostic MCP Client Documentation + SonarCloud Code Quality

## 🎯 Overview

This patch release updates all documentation to explicitly communicate that DollhouseMCP works with **any MCP-compatible client** that supports stdio transport, not just Claude Desktop. Also includes additional SonarCloud code quality improvements (19 issues fixed).

## 📚 Documentation Changes

### Platform-Agnostic Documentation (#1236, #1237)

#### README.md
- ✅ Added "MCP Client Compatibility" section explicitly stating compatibility with ANY stdio-based MCP client
- ✅ Listed Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Gemini, and other MCP clients as supported platforms
- ✅ Updated all "Configure Claude Desktop" headers to "Configure Your MCP Client"
- ✅ Changed "Claude Desktop integration" to "MCP client integration" throughout
- ✅ Updated troubleshooting to be platform-agnostic with client-specific guidance
- ✅ Expanded External Resources to include multiple MCP clients

#### New Guide
- ✅ Created `docs/guides/MCP_CLIENT_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup guide for all MCP clients
  - Platform-agnostic installation instructions
  - Client-specific configuration examples
  - Troubleshooting for different MCP clients

### Code Comments
- ✅ `src/config/ConfigManager.ts:11` - Updated OAuth comment from "Claude Desktop integration" to "MCP client integration"
- ✅ `src/portfolio/PortfolioManager.ts:177` - Updated logging comment from "Claude Desktop visibility" to "MCP client visibility"

### Workflow Documentation (#1235)
- ✅ Added comprehensive workflow examples for efficient issue handling
- ✅ Documented issue handling best practices with real examples
- ✅ Created template for future workflow documentation

## 🧹 Code Quality Improvements

### SonarCloud Fixes (#1233, #1234)
- **S7723: Array Constructor Modernization** (15 issues fixed) - #1233
  - Replaced `new Array(length)` with `Array.from({ length })`
  - Safer, more explicit array initialization
  - Prevents common pitfalls with Array constructor

- **S7758: String Method Modernization** (4 issues fixed) - #1234
  - Modernized string handling methods
  - 2 additional issues marked as false positives (test-only patterns)

### Cleanup
- ✅ Removed temporary SonarCloud utility scripts (mark-hotspots.sh, etc.)
- ✅ Cleaned up development artifacts

## 📊 Impact

### User Experience
- **Removes artificial barrier** for Gemini and other MCP client users
- **Makes platform-agnostic nature explicit** and discoverable
- **Maintains Claude Desktop as primary example** while being inclusive of all MCP clients
- **Improves adoption** by correctly communicating true compatibility
