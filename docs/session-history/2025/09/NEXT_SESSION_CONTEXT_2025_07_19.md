# Next Session Context - July 19, 2025

## Current State Summary

### Version & Release Status
- **Current Version**: 1.2.4 (published on npm)
- **Next Version**: 1.2.5 (ready for release with collection rename)
- **Breaking Changes**: Live but mitigated with backward compatibility

### What Was Just Completed
1. **Backward Compatibility** - Old marketplace tool names now work via aliases
2. **Migration Guide** - Complete documentation for users at `docs/MIGRATION_GUIDE_COLLECTION_RENAME.md`
3. **Date References** - Fixed all January â†’ July date issues
4. **README Update** - Fully reflects new collection terminology
5. **Dependabot PRs** - Merged @types/node and @modelcontextprotocol/sdk updates

### Immediate Next Steps

#### 1. Consider v1.2.5 Release
```bash
# When ready to release:
npm version patch
npm publish
git push --tags
```

#### 2. High Priority Issues Still Open
- **#40**: Complete npm publishing documentation
- **#138**: Fix CI Environment Validation Tests (has failing tests)
- **#62**: Document auto-update system
- **#111-114**: PR review suggestions from previous work

#### 3. Monitor User Feedback
- Watch for issues related to the collection rename
- Check if users are successfully using the migration guide
- Consider analytics to track deprecated tool usage

### Key Technical Details

#### Backward Compatibility Implementation
Location: `src/server/tools/CollectionTools.ts`
- Uses array of deprecated aliases
- Each alias delegates to the new tool handler
- Deprecation notices in descriptions
- Removal planned for v2.0.0 (Q1 2026)

#### Test Coverage
- 14 tests in `test/__tests__/unit/deprecated-tool-aliases.test.ts`
- All backward compatibility verified
- Both tool registration and functionality tested

### Branch Status
- On `main` branch
- All recent work merged
- No outstanding feature branches

### Known Issues
- Extended Node Compatibility showed one failure earlier but is now passing
- May want to monitor if it fails again

### Quick Reference Commands
```bash
# Check for any deprecated tool usage in logs
grep -r "DEPRECATED" ~/.dollhouse/logs/

# Run all tests
npm test

# Check current tool count
grep -c "name:" src/server/tools/CollectionTools.ts
```

### Important Context
- Users are actively using the tool and were affected by breaking changes
- Backward compatibility gives breathing room but should plan for v2.0.0
- Date consistency issues are fully resolved
- Documentation is now accurate and up-to-date
