# Session Notes - July 29, 2025 - Repository Reorganization & NPM Publishing

## Session Summary
This session focused on completing the DollhouseMCP organization reorganization, publishing to NPM under the new @dollhousemcp scope, and setting up GitFlow workflows.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. ✅ Repository Reorganization
- Successfully pushed all 5 new repositories to GitHub:
  - catalog (private)
  - experimental (private)
  - tools-internal (private)
  - developer-kit (public)
  - website (public)
- All repos now have their initial commits and are tracking origin/main

### 2. ✅ NPM Package Published
- **Package**: `@dollhousemcp/mcp-server` v1.3.0
- **Old Package**: `@mickdarling/dollhousemcp` (deprecated)
- Successfully published to NPM under organization scope
- Updated all references in:
  - package.json
  - README.md
  - test files
  - GitHub organization profile

### 3. ✅ GitFlow Workflows PR Created
- **PR #396**: Add GitFlow support to GitHub workflows
- Added three workflow files:
  - `release-npm.yml` - Automated NPM publishing on version tags
  - `branch-protection.yml` - Enforce GitFlow rules
  - `security-audit.yml` - Updated to include develop branch
- **Status**: Tests failing due to TypeScript compilation errors

## Outstanding Issues

### PR #396 Test Failures
The GitFlow PR is failing tests with TypeScript errors in:
- `test/__tests__/unit/elements/agents/AgentManager.test.ts`
- `test/__tests__/unit/elements/emptyDirectoryHandling.test.ts`
- `test/__tests__/unit/security/errorHandler.test.ts`

**Errors Include**:
- Type 'undefined' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'
- Property 'code' does not exist on type 'Error'
- Multiple TypeScript compilation errors

**Actions Taken**:
- Merged develop branch into feature/gitflow-workflows
- Tests are re-running but still failing

### Claude Code Review Recommendations
The PR has numerous recommendations from the Claude Code review that need to be addressed.

## Current State

```

### Branch Status
- **mcp-server**: On develop branch, ahead by 1 commit (package.json changes)
- **PR #396**: feature/gitflow-workflows → develop (tests failing)

### NPM Status
- Published: `@dollhousemcp/mcp-server@1.3.0`
- GitHub package sidebar may take time to update
- Organization profile README updated with new package

## Next Priority Tasks

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Fix PR #396 Test Failures**
   - Investigate TypeScript compilation errors
   - May need to check if test files are out of sync
   - Consider if AgentManager tests need updating

2. **Address Claude Code Review**
   - Review all recommendations on PR #396
   - Implement security and code quality improvements

### Medium Priority
1. **Add 50+ personas to collection** (Issue #376)
2. **Fix test using 'category' instead of 'type'** (Issue #390)
3. **Update documentation for category removal**

### Low Priority
1. **Create performance benchmarking**

## Technical Notes

### Package.json Changes
- Name: `@mickdarling/dollhousemcp` → `@dollhousemcp/mcp-server`
- Version: 1.3.0
- Added bin entry: `mcp-server` (in addition to `dollhousemcp`)

### GitHub Actions Updates Needed
The failing tests suggest there might be:
- Missing dependencies
- Test files expecting different interfaces
- Possible mismatch between develop and feature branch

## Session End Context
- Low on context, need to preserve state
- PR #396 needs attention for test failures
- NPM publish successful but GitHub integration pending
- Multiple recommendations from security audit need addressing
