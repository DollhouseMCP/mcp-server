- Cleaned root directory (moved 3 files to proper locations)

### 3. Backward Compatibility ✅

- Tag created and pushed
- Release branch merged back to develop
- Only issue: NPM publish failed due to CI tests

## Current State

### Branches
- **main**: Has v1.3.1 (all changes merged)
- **develop**: Up to date with main + version bump
- **Active branch**: develop

### Version
- Released: v1.3.1 (on GitHub, not NPM yet)
- Package ready for NPM publish

### Open Issues
- Issue #392: Documentation updates - COMPLETE (can be closed)
- NPM release workflow needs fixing (CI environment tests)

### Key Changes in v1.3.1
1. GitFlow workflows
2. Documentation reflecting flat structure
3. Backward compatibility for old tool names
4. Repository organization improvements

## For Next Session

### Priority 1: Fix NPM Release Workflow
See: `docs/development/SESSION_NOTES_2025_07_29_RELEASE_WORKFLOW_FIX_NEEDED.md`

The issue is in `.github/workflows/release-npm.yml` - CI environment tests fail because they expect variables not present in release context.

### Priority 2: Close Completed Issues
- Issue #392 can be closed (documentation updates complete)
- Check other issues that might be resolved

### Commands to Start
```bash
cd /Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Check NPM release workflow
cat .github/workflows/release-npm.yml | grep -A20 "Run tests"

# Check what v1.3.1 contains
git show v1.3.1
```

## Key Learnings
1. GitFlow process works great for controlled releases
2. Release branch gives safety net for final review
3. Need to ensure test suites work in all contexts (CI, release, local)
4. Documentation updates are best done on develop branch

*Excellent progress today! GitFlow is now the standard workflow, and the first release went smoothly except for the NPM automation issue.*
