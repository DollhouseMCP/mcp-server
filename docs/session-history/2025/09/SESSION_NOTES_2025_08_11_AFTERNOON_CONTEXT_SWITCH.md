# Session Notes - August 11, 2025 - Afternoon Context Switch

## Current Branch
`fix/yaml-bomb-error-handling-type-safety`

## Session Accomplishments

### ✅ Phase 1 Completed

#### 1. Security Fixes for Portfolio Frontmatter
- **PR #550 Created**: Comprehensive fix for issues #544 and #543
- **Branch**: `fix/portfolio-security-validation` 
- **Status**: All tests passing, awaiting review
- Added robust frontmatter detection using gray-matter
- Full security validation for existing frontmatter
- 12 security tests added

#### 2. YAML Bomb Protection (95% Complete)
- **Issue #364**: Added YAML bomb detection to ContentValidator
- **Status**: Implementation done, 11/13 tests passing
- Detects recursive YAML structures
- Prevents amplification attacks
- Blocks denial of service attempts

### 📁 Files Modified Today

#### Security Validation (PR #550)
- `src/tools/portfolio/PortfolioElementAdapter.ts` - Complete security overhaul
- `test/__tests__/unit/tools/portfolio/PortfolioElementAdapter.test.ts` - 12 tests

#### YAML Bomb Protection (Current Branch)
- `src/security/contentValidator.ts` - Added YAML_BOMB_PATTERNS and detection logic
- `test/__tests__/unit/security/yamlBombDetection.test.ts` - 13 comprehensive tests

### 🔧 What's Working

#### YAML Bomb Detection Success:
✅ Direct array recursion: `&a [*a]`
✅ Direct object recursion: `&bomb {nested: *bomb}`
✅ Amplification attacks: >10 aliases per anchor
✅ Deeply nested anchors: `&a [&b [&c [...]]]`
✅ Performance: <100ms for large YAML files
✅ Legitimate YAML preserved

#### Minor Fixes Needed:
- Value recursion pattern (1 test failing)
- Excessive aliases proximity pattern (1 test failing)

### 📋 Remaining Work

#### High Priority
1. **Remove Deprecated Aliases** (#548) - Quick performance win
2. **Error Handling Consistency** - User emphasized importance
3. **Type Safety Improvements** - User wants rigor here

#### Medium Priority
4. **Enhanced Submit Workflow** (#549)
5. **Element Readability** (#547)
6. **Tool Consolidation** (#546)
7. **Portfolio .gitkeep** (#545)

### 🚀 Next Session Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Get on the working branch
cd /Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server
git checkout fix/yaml-bomb-error-handling-type-safety
git pull

# 2. Check PR #550 status (probably merged by then)
gh pr view 550

# 3. See current test status
npm test -- test/__tests__/unit/security/yamlBombDetection.test.ts --no-coverage

# 4. Fix the 2 failing patterns (minor regex adjustments needed)
# - Value recursion pattern at line 55
# - Excessive aliases pattern at line 115

# 5. Continue with error handling and type safety
```

### 🎯 Key Issues to Address Next

#### Error Handling (User Priority!)
- #498: Improve error handling consistency in submitToPortfolioTool
- #415: Improve error handling across element system
- #407: Standardize error handling across element methods

#### Type Safety (User Priority!)
- #497: Type safety improvements in submitToPortfolioTool
- #223: Improve YamlValidator error handling and type safety
- #322: Use TypeScript enums instead of string unions

### 💡 Important Notes

1. **Don't modify PortfolioElementAdapter.ts** - PR #550 pending
2. **YAML bomb patterns work** - Just need minor regex tweaks
3. **User had real YAML bomb incident** - This is critical
4. **Error handling is critical** - "Will bite us" per user
5. **Type safety always beneficial** - User emphasis

### 📊 Session Statistics
- **PRs Created**: 1 (#550)
- **Issues Addressed**: 5 (#544, #543, #364, partial #498, #497)
- **Tests Added**: 25 total
- **Security Improvements**: 3 major (frontmatter, YAML bombs, validation)
- **Branches Active**: 2

### 🔑 Context for Reviewer

The user specifically requested focus on:
1. **YAML bomb protection** - Previous incident made this critical
2. **Error handling consistency** - Debugging concerns
3. **Type safety rigor** - Prevent runtime errors

All three are being addressed with YAML bombs nearly complete.
