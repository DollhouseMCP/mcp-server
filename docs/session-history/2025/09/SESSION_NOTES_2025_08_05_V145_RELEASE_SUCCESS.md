# Session Notes - August 5, 2025 - v1.4.5 Release Success

## Session Overview
**Duration**: Extended session (morning through afternoon)
**Focus**: Fix critical "Server disconnected" error in Claude Desktop
**Result**: âœ… Successfully released v1.4.5 with comprehensive fix

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Debugged & Fixed Critical Issue âœ…
- **Problem**: NPM-installed DollhouseMCP showed "Server disconnected" in Claude Desktop
- **Root Cause**: Startup detection logic failed for npx/CLI execution paths
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive execution detection with progressive retry

### 2. Security & Code Quality Improvements âœ…
- Removed detailed error logging to prevent information disclosure
- Replaced magic 50ms delay with progressive retry (10â†’50â†’100â†’200ms)
- Added Unicode normalization to debug scripts
- Created 16 comprehensive tests for execution detection

### 3. Successfully Released v1.4.5 âœ…
- PR #461 created, reviewed, and merged
- All CI/CD checks passed
- NPM package published automatically
- GitHub release created
- Verified working on clean machine installation

### 4. Documentation & Knowledge Sharing âœ…
- Created comprehensive blog post about the debugging journey
- Moved blog content to website repository for future publication
- Updated README with v1.4.5 information
- Created both human-friendly and AI-friendly documentation

## Technical Details

### The Fix
```javascript
// Progressive execution detection
const isDirectExecution = import.meta.url === `file://${process.argv[1]}`;
const isNpxExecution = process.env.npm_execpath?.includes('npx');
const isCliExecution = process.argv[1]?.endsWith('/dollhousemcp');

// Progressive retry delays
const STARTUP_DELAYS = [10, 50, 100, 200];
```

### Files Modified
- `src/index.ts` - Core fix implementation
- `test/__tests__/unit/execution-detection.test.ts` - New test suite
- `debug/test-synchronous-init.js` - Security fix
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Release notes
- `README.md` - Version update

## Key Learnings

### Debugging ESM Module Execution
1. `import.meta.url` differs from `process.argv[1]` in npx/CLI contexts
2. NPX creates temporary execution paths that don't match module location
3. Progressive retries accommodate varying initialization speeds

### Best Practices Reinforced
1. Always test with actual npm installation, not just local builds
2. Support multiple execution methods (direct, npx, CLI)
3. Minimal error messages in production for security
4. Comprehensive tests prevent regression

## Blog Post Created

**Title**: "How We Fixed the 'Server Disconnected' Error in Claude Desktop MCP Servers"

**Location**: `/website/content/blog/fixing-mcp-server-disconnected-claude-desktop.md`

**Features**:
- Step-by-step debugging journey
