#### 3. Code Updates âœ…
- Updated `src/config/constants.ts`:
  - REPO_OWNER: 'DollhouseMCP'
  - REPO_NAME: 'mcp-server'
  - MARKETPLACE_REPO_OWNER: 'DollhouseMCP'
  - MARKETPLACE_REPO_NAME: 'personas'

## ðŸ“‹ Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Clean Up Old References (Low Priority)
Still ~50 references to old URLs in:
- Development documentation (historical records - OK to keep)
- Test files (may need updating)
- Old session summaries (historical - OK to keep)

### 2. Update NPM Package (Next Release)
When publishing next version:
- Package already works perfectly
- Just has old GitHub URLs in package.json
- Will be fixed in next release automatically

### 3. Verify Redirects
GitHub automatically redirects old URLs, but verify:
- Clone commands work
- Issue links redirect properly
- Release links work

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Key Configuration Changes
```typescript
// src/config/constants.ts
export const REPO_OWNER = 'DollhouseMCP';
export const REPO_NAME = 'mcp-server';
export const MARKETPLACE_REPO_OWNER = 'DollhouseMCP';
export const MARKETPLACE_REPO_NAME = 'personas';
```

### GitHub GraphQL Mutations Used
```graphql
# Created project fields
mutation createProjectV2Field
