# Critical Context for Next Session - July 11, 2025

## Current Working State
- **Branch**: `fix-file-locking-race-conditions` (NOT pushed to remote yet)
- **Issue**: #204 - HIGH SECURITY: Race Conditions in Concurrent File Operations
- **Status**: FileLockManager complete, integration partially done

## Key Accomplishments Today
1. **PR #209** (Security Implementation) - Successfully merged
2. **PR #222** (CodeQL fixes) - Created, reviewed, and merged
3. **Issues Created**: #216-221 (PR #209 follow-ups), #223 (PR #222 improvements)
4. **FileLockManager**: Fully implemented and tested

## Critical Code State

### FileLockManager Implementation
- `/src/security/fileLockManager.ts` - COMPLETE ‚úÖ
- `/src/security/index.ts` - Updated with export ‚úÖ
- `/__tests__/unit/security/fileLockManager.test.ts` - 10 tests passing ‚úÖ

### Integration Status
- `/src/index.ts`:
  - Lines 22: Added FileLockManager import ‚úÖ
  - Lines 851-870: createPersona partially integrated üîÑ
  - Lines 1068+: editPersona NOT integrated yet ‚ùå

### TypeScript Compilation
- There was a syntax error with duplicate catch blocks
- Fixed by removing extra brace at line 885
- Current state: Need to verify compilation

## Next Session Must-Do
1. **First**: Check TypeScript compilation (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
2. **Test**: Run tests to ensure nothing broke
3. **Complete**: Finish createPersona integration
4. **Add**: editPersona file locking
5. **Extend**: Add locking to all file operations

## Important Notes
- The atomicWriteFile method writes to temp file then renames
- Use `persona:${name}` as lock key for persona operations
- Use `file:${path}` as lock key for general file operations
- FileLockManager has metrics tracking built in

## Security Issues Status
- **HIGH**: #204 (File Locking) - IN PROGRESS
- **HIGH**: #202 (Token Security) - NOT STARTED
- **MEDIUM**: #221 (PathValidator race condition) - Created today
- **CodeQL**: 4 alerts fixed in PR #222, waiting for scan confirmation

## Repository State
- Connected to correct remote: `https://github.com/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server.git`
- Main branch is up to date with PR #209 and PR #222 merged
- Local branch has uncommitted changes to index.ts

## Testing Note
- 589 tests total
- 1 Docker test failing (unrelated to our changes)
- All security tests passing
- FileLockManager tests all passing

Remember: The file locking implementation is critical for preventing data corruption in concurrent operations!
