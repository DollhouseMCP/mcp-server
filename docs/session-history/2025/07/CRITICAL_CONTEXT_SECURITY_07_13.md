# Critical Context for Next Session - Security Work July 13, 2025

## Key Accomplishments
1. **PR #257 (Unicode Normalization) - MERGED** âœ…
   - Fixed Issue #253 completely
   - All review feedback addressed
   - Created follow-up issues #258, #259

2. **Security Audit Suppressions - STARTED BUT BROKEN** ðŸ”´
   - Branch: `fix-security-audit-suppressions`
   - Files created but suppressions NOT applying
   - Need to debug import/integration issue

## Critical Problem to Solve
The suppressions file exists but isn't working:
- Created: `src/security/audit/config/suppressions.ts`
- Modified: `src/security/audit/SecurityAuditor.ts` to import and use it
- **BUG**: Still showing 68 findings instead of ~15

## Most Likely Issues
1. Import path might be wrong in SecurityAuditor.ts
2. File might not be building correctly
3. Pattern matching logic might have bugs
4. Relative vs absolute path mismatch

## Debug Steps for Next Session
```bash
# 1. Check if it builds
npm run build

# 2. Add console.log to verify shouldSuppress is called
# In SecurityAuditor.ts filterSuppressions method:
console.log('Checking suppression for:', finding.ruleId, finding.file);

# 3. Test pattern matching separately
# Create a test file to verify patterns work
```

## Security Findings Breakdown (Current)
- 2 Critical: SQL injection false positives (UpdateManager.ts)
- 6 High: YAML parsing (3), Persona loading (2), XSS pattern (1)
- 31 Medium: Mostly Unicode normalization false positives
- 29 Low: Audit logging false positives

## Expected After Fix
- 0 Critical (both are false positives)
- 2-3 High (keep legitimate YAML/persona issues)
- 5-10 Medium (only real Unicode issues)
- 5-10 Low (only real audit logging needs)

## File Path Patterns That Must Work
```typescript
// These patterns in suppressions.ts must match:
'src/update/UpdateManager.ts' // Exact match
'src/types/*.ts'              // Wildcard
'**/*.test.ts'                // Recursive wildcard
'__tests__/**/*'              // Directory wildcard
```

## Remember
- The CI is failing with 171 findings (different from local 68)
- We need suppressions working before creating PR
- Each suppression has a documented reason
- Don't suppress legitimate security issues

## Quick Test Command
```bash
# This should show the reduction when working:
npm run security:audit 2>&1 | grep "Total findings:"
# Current: Total findings: 68
# Target: Total findings: 10-15
```
