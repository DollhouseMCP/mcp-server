# Session Context - July 11, 2025

## Session Timeline

### Morning Session
1. Fixed PR #197 critical security issues (ReDoS, SSRF, rate limiting)
2. Updated documentation and created reference files
3. Requested review and updated PR checklist

### Evening Session (Current)
1. Merged PR #197 - Export/Import/Sharing feature complete
2. Created Issue #198 - Follow-up security review
3. Analyzed comprehensive security audit files:
   - `/Users/mick/Developer/MCP-Servers/Notes/Audit-July-11th-2025/dollhousemcp_security_audit.md`
   - `/Users/mick/Developer/MCP-Servers/Notes/Audit-July-11th-2025/dollhousemcp_testing_infrastructure.md`
4. Created 11 GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities and testing

## Key Achievements
- ✅ PR #197 merged with all security fixes
- ✅ 11 security issues created and prioritized
- ✅ Comprehensive security documentation prepared
- ✅ Ready to begin security implementation

## Important Context for Next Session

### Security Vulnerabilities Summary
- **3 CRITICAL**: Command injection, path traversal, YAML RCE
- **3 HIGH**: Token security, input validation, race conditions  
- **3 MEDIUM**: Error disclosure, rate limiting, session management
- **1 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE**: Security testing framework

### Implementation Priority
1. **Security testing framework** - Without tests, can't safely fix
2. **Command injection** - RCE in auto-update system
3. **Path traversal** - Arbitrary file access
4. **YAML deserialization** - Code execution via personas

### Code Already Prepared
All security validator templates are ready in:
- `docs/development/SECURITY_CODE_TEMPLATES.md`

Just copy/paste and integrate!

### Branch Strategy
```bash
# Start with
git checkout -b security-implementation

# Create structure
mkdir -p __tests__/security/framework
mkdir -p __tests__/security/tests  
mkdir -p src/security/validators
```

### Testing Commands Ready
```json
{
  "security:critical": "jest __tests__/security/critical --maxWorkers=4",
  "security:rapid": "npm run security:critical && npm audit",
  "pre-commit": "npm run security:rapid"
}
```

## Notes
- User discovered audit files in `/Users/mick/Developer/MCP-Servers/Notes/Audit-July-11th-2025/`
- Audit was comprehensive with code examples and implementation timelines
- All issues created successfully except "security" label doesn't exist
- Ready for 4-day security implementation sprint

## Next Session Must-Do
1. Create security test framework first
2. Run `npm run security:critical` to establish baseline
3. Fix vulnerabilities with TDD approach
4. Each fix must have tests before implementation
