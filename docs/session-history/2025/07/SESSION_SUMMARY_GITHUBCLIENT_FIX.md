# Session Summary - GitHubClient Test Fix Attempt

**Date**: July 5, 2025  
**Branch**: fix/githubclient-test-typescript  
**PR**: #56  

## What Was Attempted

### Goal
Fix the pre-existing GitHubClient.test.ts TypeScript errors that were causing CI failures

### Issue
```
error TS2345: Argument of type '{ name: string; stars: number; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'.
```

This error occurred on all jest.fn() mock calls throughout the test file.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Focused Branch
- Created `fix/githubclient-test-typescript` branch
- Focused only on fixing the TypeScript compilation errors

### 2. Attempted Multiple Solutions
1. **First Attempt**: Proper TypeScript typing for mockFetch
   - `jest.fn<Promise<Response>, [RequestInfo | URL, RequestInit?]>()`
   - Result: More complex type errors

2. **Second Attempt**: jest.MockedFunction typing
   - `jest.fn() as jest.MockedFunction<typeof fetch>`
   - Result: Still had nested mock issues

3. **Third Attempt**: Helper functions
   - Created `createMockResponse()` helpers
   - Result: Reduced some errors but not all

4. **Final Solution**: Type assertions
   - Added `as any` to all jest.fn() calls
   - `(jest.fn() as any).mockResolvedValue(...)`
   - Result: TypeScript errors resolved ✅

### 3. Created PR #56
- Pushed branch with TypeScript fixes
- Created detailed PR explaining the issue and solution
- Noted that runtime ESM issues remain

## Current Status

### What's Fixed ✅
- TypeScript compilation errors in GitHubClient.test.ts
- Tests now compile without TypeScript errors

### What's NOT Fixed ❌
- Runtime ESM/CommonJS module compatibility issue
- Tests fail with: `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module`
- This appears to be related to @modelcontextprotocol/sdk imports

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be a conflict between:
1. Jest's module handling (CommonJS by default)
2. @modelcontextprotocol/sdk using ES modules
3. Our Jest configuration not properly transforming the SDK

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Fix Jest Configuration
- Update transformIgnorePatterns
- Ensure proper ESM handling for @modelcontextprotocol packages
- May need to update Jest setup

### Option 2: Mock the SDK
- Create mocks for McpError and ErrorCode
- Avoid importing from the actual SDK in tests

### Option 3: Different Test Strategy
- Use a different testing approach for files that import from the SDK
- Consider integration tests instead of unit tests

## Documentation Created
1. `OUTSTANDING_ISSUES_2025_07_05.md` - Comprehensive list of remaining issues
2. `SESSION_SUMMARY_GITHUBCLIENT_FIX.md` - This summary

## Lessons Learned
1. TypeScript + Jest + ESM modules can be complex
2. Type assertions (`as any`) are sometimes necessary for mock functions
3. Module compatibility issues require careful configuration
4. Focused PRs are good even if they don't fully solve the problem

## Recommendation
The TypeScript fix should be merged as it's an improvement, but a follow-up PR will be needed to address the ESM module issues. This might require deeper changes to the Jest configuration or test structure.
