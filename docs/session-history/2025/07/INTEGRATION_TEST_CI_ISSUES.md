# Integration Test CI Issues & Resolution Plan

## Summary
PR #54 has been merged with all 11 integration tests passing. However, CI is failing due to pre-existing issues unrelated to the integration test framework.

## Current CI Issues

### 1. GitHubClient.test.ts TypeScript/Jest Mock Issues
**Status**: Pre-existing issue, NOT caused by integration test PR
**Location**: `__tests__/unit/GitHubClient.test.ts`
**Error**: TypeScript errors with Jest mock typing

**Symptoms**:
```
error TS2345: Argument of type 'Response' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'.
error TS2345: Argument of type '{ success: boolean; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'never'.
```

**Root Cause**: 
- Jest mock typing incompatibility with TypeScript
- The `mockFetch` global mock has typing issues

### 2. Test Separation Issue (FIXED)
**Status**: Fixed in PR #54
**Fix**: Added `testPathIgnorePatterns` to `jest.config.cjs` to exclude integration tests from unit runs

## Verification Todo List

### High Priority - Verify CI Issues
- [ ] Create new PR to fix GitHubClient.test.ts mock typing
- [ ] Verify that integration tests only run with `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Confirm unit tests pass locally after GitHubClient fix
- [ ] Check if CI has any other hidden issues

### Medium Priority - Verify Integration Test Implementation
- [ ] Confirm all 11 integration tests pass in isolation
- [ ] Verify race condition fix is working (Promise.allSettled + delay)
- [ ] Test YAML parsing with complex personas
- [ ] Verify environment variable defensive checks work
- [ ] Test error recovery with various corrupted files

### Low Priority - Future Improvements
- [ ] Consider migrating GitHubClient tests to use MSW instead of manual mocks
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for integration tests
- [ ] Consider reducing integration test timeout from 30s to 15-20s

## Quick Fix for CI

To get CI passing immediately, create a new PR with:

```typescript
// In __tests__/unit/GitHubClient.test.ts
// Add proper typing to mockFetch
const mockFetch = jest.fn<Promise<Response>, [RequestInfo | URL, RequestInit?]>();
global.fetch = mockFetch as typeof fetch;

// Or use @ts-expect-error comments for problematic lines
```

## Integration Test Framework Status

### What Was Implemented
1. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Jest configuration for integration tests (`jest.integration.config.cjs`)
   - Test helpers (file-utils, test-server, test-fixtures)
   - Global setup/teardown for test isolation
   - TypeScript config for tests (`tsconfig.test.json`)

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Persona loading from file system
   - Persona creation and persistence
   - Activation/deactivation workflows
   - Editing with concurrent access handling
   - Error recovery and corrupted file handling

3. **Key Fixes Applied**
   - YAML parsing using gray-matter
   - Race condition handling with Promise.allSettled
   - File permission cleanup with try/finally
   - Environment variable defensive checks
   - Test isolation from unit test runs

### Running Integration Tests
```bash
# Run integration tests only
NODE_OPTIONS='--experimental-vm-modules' npm run test:integration

# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Run with coverage
npm run test:integration:coverage
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix GitHubClient.test.ts in a separate PR
2. **Short-term**: Add GitHub API integration tests
3. **Medium-term**: Add MCP protocol compliance tests
4. **Long-term**: CI/CD integration for automated testing
