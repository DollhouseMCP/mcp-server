# Context Handoff - July 7, 2025

## Session Summary

This session achieved several major milestones for the DollhouseMCP project, most notably reaching **100% CI pass rate** and enabling branch protection.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed Docker Testing (Issue #115) ✅
- **Problem**: BackupManager detected Docker's `/app` directory as production and refused to initialize
- **Solution**: PR #116 added Docker environment detection
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `isDockerEnvironment()` method to BackupManager
  - Checks for `DOLLHOUSE_DISABLE_UPDATES=true`, `/app` directory, and `/.dockerenv` file
  - Set `DOLLHOUSE_DISABLE_UPDATES=true` in Dockerfile
- **Result**: All Docker tests now pass (linux/amd64, linux/arm64, Docker Compose)

### 2. Achieved 100% CI Coverage ✅
All workflows now passing on main branch:
- ✅ Core Build & Test
- ✅ Build Artifacts
- ✅ Docker Testing (was failing)
- ✅ Cross-Platform Simple
- ✅ Extended Node Compatibility
- ✅ Performance Testing

### 3. Enabled Branch Protection ✅
Successfully configured with:
- 7 required status checks (all platform tests + Docker)
- Strict mode (branches must be up to date)
- 1 required review
- Dismiss stale reviews on new commits
- No force pushes or deletions

### 4. Project Management Improvements ✅
- **PR #121**: Added priority synchronization scripts
- Synced all 48 issues (open and closed) with project priority field
- Created tools for ongoing priority management
- Added input validation per review feedback

### 5. Issue Cleanup ✅
Closed resolved issues:
- #101: Jest ESM module resolution (was already fixed)
- #102: Docker initialization (fixed by PR #116)
- #90, #91: Environment validation duplicates

Created new issues:
- #117: Add unit tests for Docker detection
- #118: Add JSDoc documentation
- #119: Monitor Docker path flexibility
- #120: Clean up root directory organization

## Current Project State

### CI/CD Status
- All workflows passing consistently
- Branch protection enabled and enforced
- Docker testing fixed and stable

### Open High Priority Issues
1. **#92**: Create tests to verify CI fixes
2. **#62**: Document auto-update system  
3. **#53**: Security audit automation
4. **#40**: Prepare npm publishing
5. **#32**: Universal installer
6. **#30**: Multi-platform MCP research
7. **#29**: MCP protocol integration tests

### Project Board Organization
- All issues added to project board
- Priorities synced (P0=High, P1=Medium, P2=Low)
- Status columns: Triage, Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, Done

## Established Patterns

### PR Creation Workflow
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b fix-<description>`
2. Make changes with comprehensive commits
3. Push and create PR with detailed description
4. Monitor CI and reviews
5. Address feedback immediately
6. Create issues for future work from review suggestions

### Shell Compatibility
Always use `shell: bash` in workflows:
```yaml
- name: Step name
  shell: bash
  run: |
    # Commands here
```

### Docker Detection Pattern
```typescript
private isDockerEnvironment(): boolean {
  if (process.env.DOLLHOUSE_DISABLE_UPDATES === 'true') return true;
  if (this.rootDir === '/app') return true;
  if (fsSync.existsSync('/.dockerenv')) return true;
  return false;
}
```

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate Tasks
1. Document branch protection settings (Issue #9)
2. Work on high-priority Ready issues
3. Address review suggestions (Issues #111-114)

### Medium Term
1. Create tests for CI fixes (#92)
2. Document auto-update system (#62)
3. NPM publishing preparation (#40)

### Strategic Goals
1. Maintain 100% CI pass rate
2. Improve test coverage
3. Prepare for npm publication
4. Enhance documentation

## Key Files and Locations

### CI Workflows
- `.github/workflows/core-build-test.yml`
- `.github/workflows/docker-testing.yml`
- `.github/workflows/extended-node-compatibility.yml`

### Project Management
- `scripts/project-management.sh` - Main menu
- `scripts/sync-project-priorities.sh` - Priority sync
- `scripts/README_PRIORITY_SYNC.md` - Documentation

### Recent Changes
- `src/update/BackupManager.ts` - Docker detection
- `Dockerfile` - DOLLHOUSE_DISABLE_UPDATES env var

## Important Context

### Branch Protection
Enabled with strict requirements. All changes must:
- Pass 7 required status checks
- Have up-to-date branch
- Get 1 approval
- Go through PR process

### Project Workflow
- New issues auto-add to project
- Move to "In Progress" when starting work
- Move to "In Review" when PR created
- Move to "Done" when merged

### Priority System
- Labels: priority: high/medium/low
- Project field: P0/P1/P2
- Both stay synchronized via scripts

## Session Statistics
- Fixed 1 critical blocker (Docker testing)
- Closed 5 issues
- Created 4 new issues
- Merged 2 PRs (#116, #121)
- Enabled branch protection
- Organized 48 issues in project board
