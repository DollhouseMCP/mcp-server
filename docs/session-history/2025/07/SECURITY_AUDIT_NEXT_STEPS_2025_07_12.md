# Security Audit - Next Steps
## PR #250 Final Tasks

### Immediate Actions (First 5 Minutes)

1. **Check Latest CI Run**
```bash
gh pr checks 250
gh pr view 250 --comments  # Check Claude bot review
```

2. **Verify SARIF Generation**
```bash
# Check if SARIF upload succeeded in latest run
gh run list --branch implement-security-audit-automation-53 --limit 1
gh run view <RUN_ID> --log | grep -A 10 "Upload SARIF"
```

3. **Review Security Findings**
```bash
# Download and review the security audit results
gh run download <RUN_ID> -n security-audit-results
cat security-audit-report.md
```

### Critical Fixes Needed

Based on the 172 findings, we need to:

1. **Review Each Finding Category**
   - Determine which are false positives
   - Identify critical issues that must be fixed
   - Create suppression rules for acceptable patterns

2. **Common Patterns to Address**
   - String concatenation that looks like SQL
   - Template literals with user input
   - File operations that need validation
   - Missing rate limiting on endpoints

3. **Suppression Configuration**
   - Add suppressions for test files
   - Suppress findings in generated/build files
   - Configure per-file suppressions where needed

### PR #250 Merge Checklist

- [ ] All CI checks passing (except security audit)
- [ ] Claude bot review addressed
- [ ] SARIF upload working
- [ ] Create Issue #249 for enhancements
- [ ] Document security findings for future work
- [ ] Merge PR to achieve 100% coverage

### Security Findings Categories

From the 172 findings, expect to see:
1. **SQL Injection** - String concatenation with SQL keywords
2. **Path Traversal** - File operations with user input
3. **Token Validation** - Missing validation checks
4. **Rate Limiting** - Endpoints without rate limits
5. **Command Injection** - Shell command construction
6. **XSS** - Unescaped user input in responses

### Configuration Tuning Options

If too many false positives remain:

```typescript
// In SecurityRules.ts, adjust patterns:
- Make patterns more specific
- Add context requirements
- Check for mitigation patterns

// In SecurityAuditor.ts, add suppressions:
suppressions: [
  {
    rule: 'CWE-89-001',
    file: 'src/database/queries.ts',
    reason: 'Uses parameterized queries'
  }
]
```

### Success Criteria

PR #250 can be merged when:
1. Implementation is complete ✅
2. All tests pass ✅
3. CI pipeline works ✅
4. Security audit runs successfully ✅
5. Findings are documented ⏳
6. SARIF uploads to GitHub ⏳

### Post-Merge Tasks

1. **Create follow-up issues** for each category of security findings
2. **Prioritize critical findings** for immediate fixes
3. **Configure suppressions** for acceptable patterns
4. **Set up monitoring** for security audit results
5. **Document security posture** in README

### Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Continue where we left off
cd /Users/mick/Developer/MCP-Servers/DollhouseMCP
git checkout implement-security-audit-automation-53
gh pr view 250

# Check what happened with latest push
gh run list --branch implement-security-audit-automation-53 --limit 5

# Review security findings
gh api /repos/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server/pulls/250/comments | jq '.[] | select(.body | contains("Security Audit"))'
```

### Remember
- The implementation is COMPLETE
- We're just dealing with legitimate findings now
- The goal is to merge PR #250 and document findings
- Don't over-engineer fixes - document and move forward
