## Architecture Analysis

### Proposed Integration Pattern

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Claude Code CLI                  │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│    DollhouseMCP Plugin (Potential)       │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │ Slash Commands                     │  │
│  │ /dollhouse enable → activate_element│  │
│  │ /dollhouse status → get_active     │  │
│  └────────────────────────────────────┘  │
├──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│    DollhouseMCP MCP Server (Existing)    │
│    All business logic remains here       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Design Principle

Plugin as UX Enhancement Layer: The plugin would serve as a user experience enhancement, not a logic layer. All business logic remains in the MCP server, ensuring compatibility and maintainability.

## Technical Implementation Analysis

### Repository Structure

A potential plugin structure could look like:

```
DollhouseMCP/claude-code-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   ├── plugin.json           # Plugin metadata
│   └── marketplace.json      # Marketplace configuration
├── commands/
│   ├── dollhouse-enable.md   # /dollhouse enable
│   ├── dollhouse-disable.md  # /dollhouse disable
│   ├── dollhouse-status.md   # /dollhouse status
│   ├── dollhouse-search.md   # /dollhouse search
│   └── dollhouse-help.md     # /dollhouse help
├── README.md                 # User guide
└── LICENSE                   # AGPL-3.0
```

### Plugin Manifest

```json
{
  "name": "dollhousemcp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Enhanced commands for DollhouseMCP AI customization",
  "author": "DollhouseMCP",
  "license": "AGPL-3.0",
  "repository": "https://github.com/DollhouseMCP/claude-code-plugin",
  "requires": {
    "mcpServers": ["@dollhousemcp/mcp-server"]
  }
}
```

### Marketplace Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "DollhouseMCP Official Plugins",
  "owner": "DollhouseMCP",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "dollhousemcp",
      "description": "Simplified commands for DollhouseMCP elements",
      "source": "./",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "tags": ["productivity", "ai-customization", "mcp"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Command Implementation Pattern

Example command structure for element activation:

```markdown
---
description: Enable a DollhouseMCP element (persona, skill, template, etc.)
argument-hint: element-name
---

Enable the DollhouseMCP element: {{element_name}}

First, use the search_portfolio tool to find "{{element_name}}" in the portfolio.
If found, use the activate_element tool to enable it.
Confirm activation by showing the element details.
If not found, suggest similar elements using fuzzy matching.
```

### Potential Command Set

| Command | Purpose | MCP Tool Mapping |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| `/dollhouse enable [element]` | Activate element | `activate_element({name: element})` |
| `/dollhouse disable [element]` | Deactivate element | `deactivate_element({name: element})` |
| `/dollhouse status` | Show active elements | `get_active_elements()` |
| `/dollhouse search [query]` | Find elements | `search_portfolio({query})` |

---

## Integration Points

### Command to MCP Tool Mapping

```typescript
// Plugin commands would map to existing MCP tools
'/dollhouse enable X'  → mcp.activate_element({name: X})
'/dollhouse disable X' → mcp.deactivate_element({name: X})
'/dollhouse status'    → mcp.get_active_elements()
'/dollhouse search X'  → mcp.search_portfolio({query: X})
```

### Critical Implementation Considerations

1. **Element Naming**: Must handle variations (kebab-case, spaces, capitals)
2. **Search Functionality**: Leverage existing fuzzy matching capabilities
3. **Error Messages**: User-friendly responses with correction suggestions
4. **MCP Dependency**: Graceful handling if MCP server not installed
5. **Version Compatibility**: Ensure plugin works across MCP server versions

---

## Benefits Analysis
