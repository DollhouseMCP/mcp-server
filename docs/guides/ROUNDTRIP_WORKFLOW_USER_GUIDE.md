## Phase 3: Customization - Local Development

### List Your Elements

See what you have available for customization:

```
list_elements
list_elements type="personas"
get_element_details "creative-writer" type="personas"
```

### Edit Element Content

Customize elements to better fit your needs:

```
# Edit a persona to change its behavior
edit_element "creative-writer" type="personas" version="1.1.0"

# This opens the element for editing where you can modify:
# - Instructions and behavior
# - Response style and tone
# - Specialized knowledge areas
# - Interaction patterns
```

### Version Management

Each time you edit an element, the version is automatically updated:

```
# Check current version
get_element_details "creative-writer" type="personas"

# After editing, version automatically increments (e.g., 1.0.0 â†’ 1.1.0)
```

### Validate Your Changes

Ensure your customizations are valid:

```
validate_element "creative-writer" type="personas"
```

### Test Your Customizations

Activate and test your modified elements:

```
# Test the customized persona
activate_element "creative-writer" type="personas"

# Ask it to demonstrate the changes you made
# "Please introduce yourself and explain your approach to creative writing"
```

### Example: Customizing a Code Review Skill

```
# Start with an existing skill
install_element "library/skills/code-reviewer.md"

# Review what we have
get_element_details "code-reviewer" type="skills"

# Customize it for your specific tech stack
edit_element "code-reviewer" type="skills" version="1.1.0"

# In the editor, modify the skill to focus on:
# - Your programming languages (Python, TypeScript, etc.)
# - Your coding standards and style guides
# - Security practices specific to your domain
# - Performance considerations for your use cases

# Validate the changes
validate_element "code-reviewer" type="skills"

# Test with a sample code review
activate_element "code-reviewer" type="skills"
```

**ðŸ’¡ Customization Best Practices:**
- Start with small changes and test incrementally
- Keep track of what you've modified
- Use meaningful version numbers
- Document your changes in commit messages
- Test thoroughly before sharing

## Phase 4: Portfolio Management - GitHub Integration

### Check Portfolio Status

First, check if you have a portfolio set up:

```
portfolio_status
```

If you don't have a portfolio yet, you'll see instructions to create one.

### Initialize Your Portfolio (First Time Only)

Create your GitHub portfolio repository:

```
init_portfolio repository_name="dollhouse-portfolio" private=false
```

This creates:
- A new GitHub repository under your account
- Proper directory structure for different element types
- README with portfolio information
- Initial configuration files

### Configure Portfolio Settings

Set up your preferences for portfolio management:

```
portfolio_config auto_sync=true auto_submit=false default_visibility="public"
```

Settings explained:
- **auto_sync**: Automatically push changes to GitHub when you modify elements
- **auto_submit**: Automatically create collection submission issues when you add elements
- **default_visibility**: Whether new repositories are public or private

### Upload Elements to Portfolio

Submit your customized elements to your GitHub portfolio:

```
submit_content "creative-writer"
submit_content "code-reviewer" 
submit_content "project-update-template"
```

This process:
1. Uploads the element to your GitHub repository
2. Creates a commit with metadata and changes
3. Updates the repository's element index
4. Optionally creates a collection submission (if auto_submit=true)

### Sync Your Portfolio

Keep your local portfolio synchronized with GitHub:

```
# Push local changes to GitHub
sync_portfolio direction="push"

# Pull remote changes to local
sync_portfolio direction="pull"

# Two-way synchronization
sync_portfolio direction="both"

# Preview what would be synced without making changes
sync_portfolio direction="push" dry_run=true
```

### Example: Complete Portfolio Workflow

```
# Check current status
portfolio_status

# Configure for collaborative workflow
portfolio_config auto_sync=true auto_submit=false default_visibility="public"

# Upload your customized elements
submit_content "my-creative-writer"
submit_content "my-code-reviewer"
submit_content "my-project-template"

# Check what was uploaded
portfolio_status

# Your elements are now available at:
# https://github.com/yourusername/dollhouse-portfolio
```

**ðŸ’¡ Portfolio Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive repository names
- Keep auto_sync enabled for seamless updates
- Review elements before submitting to portfolio
- Use dry_run to preview sync operations
- Regular sync to keep local and remote in harmony

---

## Phase 5: Community Sharing - Collection Submission

### Prepare Elements for Submission

Before submitting to the collection, ensure your elements are ready:

```
# Validate your element
validate_element "my-creative-writer" type="personas"

# Check it's in your portfolio
portfolio_status

# Review the element details
get_element_details "my-creative-writer" type="personas"
```

### Manual Submission Process

Submit elements individually with control over the process:

```
# Submit with manual approval
portfolio_config auto_submit=false
submit_content "my-creative-writer"
```

This gives you a link to manually create the collection issue, allowing you to:
- Review the submission details
- Add additional context or notes
- Choose the timing of submission

### Automated Submission Process

For streamlined workflow, enable automatic submission:

```
# Enable automatic submissions
portfolio_config auto_submit=true

# Now submissions automatically create collection issues
submit_content "my-code-reviewer"
```

This automatically:
1. Uploads element to your portfolio
2. Creates a collection submission issue
3. Adds appropriate labels and metadata
4. Links to your portfolio repository

### Monitor Your Submissions

Track the status of your submitted elements:

1. **Check GitHub Issues**: Visit the [collection issues page](https://github.com/DollhouseMCP/collection/issues)
2. **Look for your submissions**: Issues titled like "[skills] Add My Code Reviewer by @yourusername"
3. **Respond to feedback**: Community members may suggest improvements
4. **Follow the review process**: Elements go through quality review before inclusion

### Example: Complete Submission Workflow

```
# Prepare a high-quality element
validate_element "my-data-analyst" type="personas"

# Configure for manual submission to control timing
portfolio_config auto_submit=false

# Submit to portfolio
submit_content "my-data-analyst"

# You'll receive:
# - Link to your portfolio element
# - Manual submission link for collection
# - Instructions for creating the issue

# Create the collection issue when you're ready
# Visit the provided link and fill in any additional details
```

**ðŸ’¡ Submission Best Practices:**
- Validate elements thoroughly before submission
- Use descriptive names and clear descriptions
- Include helpful examples in element documentation
- Respond promptly to community feedback
- Consider starting with manual submissions to learn the process

## Advanced Workflows

### Collaborative Development

Work with team members on shared elements:

```
# Clone a team member's portfolio
sync_portfolio direction="pull"

# Make improvements  
edit_element "team-coding-standards" type="skills"

# Share back with team
sync_portfolio direction="push"
```

### Element Versioning

Manage different versions of elements:

```
# Create a major update
edit_element "my-reviewer" type="skills" version="2.0.0"

# Keep the old version available
# The system maintains version history
```

### Bulk Operations

Work with multiple elements efficiently:

```
# Install multiple related elements
install_element "library/ensembles/full-stack-developer.md"
# This ensemble might automatically install its component elements

# Submit multiple elements
submit_content "skill-1"
submit_content "skill-2" 
submit_content "template-1"
```
