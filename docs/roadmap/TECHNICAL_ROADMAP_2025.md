## Technical Priorities

### Core Architecture
1. **Plugin System** - Enable extensibility without core modifications
2. **Performance** - Handle 10,000+ elements efficiently
3. **Reliability** - 99.9% uptime for core operations
4. **Security** - Enterprise-grade security practices

### Platform Support
1. **Primary**: Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor
2. **Secondary**: Continue.dev, Gemini CLI, Cline
3. **Future**: ChatGPT, VS Code Copilot, custom implementations

### Developer Experience
1. **Documentation** - Comprehensive and up-to-date
2. **Testing** - 90%+ code coverage
3. **Tooling** - CLI tools for common tasks
4. **Examples** - Rich library of examples

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Plugin architecture completed and documented
- 5+ platforms fully supported
- 90%+ test coverage maintained
- Performance: <100ms element activation

### Community Metrics
- 50+ community-contributed plugins
- 500+ GitHub stars
- 100+ active contributors
- 1000+ elements in collection

### Quality Metrics
