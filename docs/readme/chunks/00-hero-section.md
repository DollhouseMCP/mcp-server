## Elements That Customize Your AI's Capabilities and Actions

**DollhouseMCP** is open source, community-powered AI customization. Create your own customization elements—personas that shape behavior, skills that add capabilities, templates for consistent outputs, agents for automation, and memories for persistent context—or use and modify an ever-growing number of customization elements from the community. Every element you create can be saved to your portfolio and used again or shared back to the DollhouseMCP Collection to help others.
