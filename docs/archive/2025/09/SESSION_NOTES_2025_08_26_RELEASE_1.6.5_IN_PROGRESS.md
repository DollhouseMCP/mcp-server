## Session Achievements
- ‚úÖ Merged intelligent version update system (PR #760)
- ‚úÖ Created release workflow documentation
- ‚úÖ Successfully used version script for first time
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Release 1.6.5 in progress but blocked by CI issues

## Context for Next Session
The release is halfway done. The version numbers are updated and the PR is created, but we need to:
1. Fix the CI issues (8 failing tests)
2. Update the branch with main
3. Address the security audit issue
4. Review and address Claude Code feedback
5. Complete the merge and tag

All the hard work is done - just need to clean up these issues and complete the release.

## Important Files/PRs
- PR #762: Release v1.6.5 (NEEDS FIXES)
- PR #761: Release workflow docs (can be merged separately)
- Version script: `scripts/update-version.mjs` (working great!)
