# Session Notes - July 29, 2025 - GitFlow Implementation and Cleanup

## Session Summary
Productive session implementing GitFlow workflows and cleaning up completed issues.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. GitFlow Workflows Implementation ✅
- **PR #396**: Created, reviewed, and merged
- Added 3 new workflows:
  - `branch-protection.yml` - Enforces GitFlow rules for PRs to main
  - `release-npm.yml` - Automated NPM publishing on version tags
  - `security-audit.yml` - Updated to include develop branch

#### Key Implementation Details
- Fixed failing tests by adding `shell: bash` to workflow steps
- Addressed all Claude review feedback:
  - Replaced deprecated `actions/create-release@v1` with `ncipollo/release-action@v1`
  - Added semantic version validation
  - Made changelog parsing robust with fallbacks
  - Added error handling for git operations
  - Fixed documentation links
- Created follow-up issues: #397, #398, #399

#### PR Best Practices Learned
- Always create detailed comment with commit SHAs after fixes
- Reference specific lines and changes
- Create follow-up issues for future improvements
- Trigger re-review after addressing feedback

### 2. Repository Push Verification ✅
- Confirmed all new repos were already pushed to GitHub on July 29:
  - catalog (private)
  - experimental (private)
  - tools-internal (private)
  - developer-kit (public)
  - website (public)

### 3. Issue #376 Resolution ✅
- "Upload all 31 default AI customization elements to collection"
- Discovered this was already completed on July 25, 2025
- All elements present in collection repository:
  - 6 personas
  - 8 skills
  - 9 templates
  - 4 agents
- Memories and ensembles excluded per security requirements
- Issue closed as already resolved

### 4. Issue #390 Investigation ✅
- "Update tests to use 'type' parameter instead of 'category'"
- Found that browse_collection already uses 'type' parameter
- No failing tests found
- Issue closed as already resolved/not applicable

## Important Decisions Made

### Agent Inclusion
- Decided to include agents in public collection
- Agents use sophisticated decision-making:
  - Eisenhower Matrix (importance × urgency)
  - Multiple decision frameworks (rule-based, ML-based, programmatic, hybrid)
  - Risk assessment
  - Goal management
- Not proprietary - uses well-established patterns

### What Remains Private
- **Memories** - Patent-pending implementation
- **Ensembles** - Patent-pending orchestration

## Current State

### Branch Status
- On `develop` branch
- All changes merged
- No pending work

### Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Push new repos to GitHub
2. ✅ Create GitFlow Workflows PR
3. ✅ Add elements to collection (Issue #376)
4. ✅ Fix test using 'category' instead of 'type' (Issue #390)

### Remaining Tasks
1. Update documentation for category removal
2. Create performance benchmarking

### Active Workflows
- Branch protection enforces GitFlow rules
- Security audits run on both main and develop
- NPM releases automated with version tags

## Key Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/branch-protection.yml`
- `.github/workflows/release-npm.yml`
- `.github/workflows/security-audit.yml`

## Next Session Should Start With

1. **Check for any new issues or PRs**
```bash
cd /Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server
gh pr list
gh issue list --limit 10
```

2. **Update documentation for category removal**
- Check what documentation needs updating
- Look for references to categories in docs/
- Update to reflect flat structure

3. **Consider performance benchmarking**
- Low priority but could be valuable
- Check if there's a specific issue for this

## Important Context
- GitFlow is now active - all changes should go through develop
- Don't commit directly to main
- Create feature branches from develop
- NPM releases happen automatically when tags are pushed to main

## Commands for Next Session
```bash
# Get on develop branch
cd /Users/mick/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/active/mcp-server
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Check status
gh pr list
gh issue list --limit 20

# For documentation updates
find docs -name "*.md" | xargs grep -l "category\|categories"
```
