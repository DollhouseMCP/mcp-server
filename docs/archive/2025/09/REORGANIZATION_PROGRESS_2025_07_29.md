# Repository Reorganization Progress
*Date: July 29, 2025*

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Content Protection
- Created comprehensive backup of all 5 repositories
  - Location: `/Users/mick/Developer/MCP-Servers/reorganization-backup-2025-07-29_11-43-00/`
  - Includes emergency restore script
  - Documented all untracked files

### 2. Repository Organization
- Set up Organizations structure with symlinks (non-destructive)
- Structure verified and working:
  ```
  ~/Developer/Organizations/DollhouseMCP/
  ├── active/
  │   ├── mcp-server/     → DollhouseMCP
  │   ├── collection/     → DollhouseMCP-Collection
  │   ├── business/       → private-dev
  │   └── website/        → (cloned from GitHub)
  └── archive/
      ├── personas-deprecated/ → DollhouseMCP-Personas
      └── original-server/     → persona-mcp-server
  ```

### 3. Untracked Files Handled
- Moved investor docs from DollhouseMCP to private-dev/documents/business/
- Added .obsidian/ to .gitignore in both repos
- Committed planning documents and session notes
- Removed empty Untitled.md file

### 4. GitHub Updates
- DollhouseMCP: Committed planning docs on feature/remove-proprietary-docs branch
- private-dev: Committed investor docs and competitor analysis
- Both repos now have clean working directories

### 5. Branching Strategy
- Created `develop` branch from main
- Updated CONTRIBUTING.md with GitFlow documentation
- Pushed develop branch to origin

### 6. Website Repository
- Cloned empty website repository to active/ directory
- Ready for future development (keeping private initially)

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. Check open issues for bugs to fix
2. Add 50+ basic personas to collection (no advanced features)

### Medium Priority
1. Create performance benchmarking framework
2. Update README and documentation (avoiding Memory/Ensemble details)

### Low Priority
1. Consider actual migration (moving repos vs symlinks)
2. Set up branch protection rules for develop

## Important Notes

### Patent Protection Reminders
- ❌ Don't publish Memory implementation
- ❌ Don't publish Ensemble orchestration details
- ❌ Don't mention conversational memory updates
- ✅ Safe to fix bugs in published code
- ✅ Safe to add basic personas
- ✅ Safe to improve documentation (carefully)

### Backup Information
- All original repositories preserved in backup
- Symlinks used for testing (non-destructive)
- Emergency restore script available if needed
