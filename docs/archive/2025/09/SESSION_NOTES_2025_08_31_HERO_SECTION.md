# Session Notes - August 31, 2025 - Hero Section & README Improvements

## Session Overview
**Date**: August 31, 2025  
**Time**: Late afternoon/evening session
**Branch**: `feature/add-hero-section`
**Context**: Adding hero section to README and preparing for version bump

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Installation Guide Updates (PR #856) ✅ MERGED
- Changed primary recommendation from global to local installation
- Added clear comparison table of installation methods
- Explained benefits of local installation (multiple configs, easy backup, no permissions)
- Added advanced examples for multiple configurations with separate portfolios

### 2. README Sync Workflow (PR #857) ✅ MERGED
Created automatic README sync workflow that:
- Triggers on changes to `docs/readme/chunks/**`
- Rebuilds all README files automatically
- Commits changes if files were modified
- Includes comprehensive security fixes and documentation

**Key Issues Fixed**:
- Command injection protection via branch name sanitization
- Infinite loop prevention with auto-commit detection
- Error handling and timeouts
- Removed `[skip ci]` that was preventing CI runs

### 3. Hero Section Addition (IN PROGRESS)
**Branch**: `feature/add-hero-section`

Created new hero section with:
- Dollhouse logo placeholder
- Compelling marketing copy
- Clear value proposition
- Use case examples
- Quick start in 60 seconds

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `/docs/readme/chunks/00-hero-section.md` - New hero section
- `/docs/readme/chunks/00-header-extended.md` - Removed old description
- `/docs/readme/config.json` - Added hero section to GitHub README

## Current State

### Hero Section Content
The hero section includes:
- **Title**: "Transform Your AI Into Anyone You Need"
- **Tagline**: "The Professional MCP Server for Dynamic AI Personality Management"
- **Key Features**: Instant switching, community marketplace, 42 tools, portfolio system
- **Use Cases**: Developers, Writers, Professionals
- **Quick Start**: 60-second installation guide

### Next Steps
1. Build the README files with hero section
2. Review and refine the hero copy
3. Commit and push changes
4. Create PR for hero section
5. Prepare for version bump

## Commands to Continue

```bash
# Current branch
git branch
# Should be: feature/add-hero-section

# Build READMEs
npm run build:readme

# Review the generated README
cat README.github.md | head -100

# Commit changes
git add -A
git commit -m "Add compelling hero section to README"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/add-hero-section
gh pr create --base develop
```

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Hero Section Placement**: After badges, before Quick Start
2. **Content Focus**: Marketing-oriented but professional
3. **Visual Elements**: Logo placeholder, use case table, quick start code
4. **Tone**: Confident, professional, feature-focused

## Files to Review
- `/docs/readme/chunks/00-hero-section.md` - Main hero content
- `/docs/readme/config.json` - Build configuration
- `README.github.md` - Generated output (after build)

## Version Bump Preparation
After hero section is merged:
1. Update version number across codebase
2. Update changelog
3. Create release PR
4. Tag and publish to NPM
