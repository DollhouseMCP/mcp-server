#### 2. Completed Full GitFlow Release Process
- âœ… Created release branch `release/v1.6.5`
- âœ… Fixed all issues identified in PR review
- âœ… Merged PR #762 to main
- âœ… Created and pushed tag `v1.6.5`
- âœ… Synced develop with main (fast-forward merge)
- âœ… Deleted release branch (local and remote)

### Key Features in v1.6.5

#### Intelligent Version Update System
- Comprehensive version management script (`scripts/update-version.mjs`)
- Automated version updates across all files
- GitHub Actions workflow for version updates
- Security hardened with validation and sanitization

#### Portfolio Sync Fix

- Resolves issues with element loading
- Improves reliability of portfolio system

#### Security Enhancements
- Path traversal protection in version script
- File size limits to prevent DoS attacks
- Input validation and sanitization

## GitFlow Process Summary

### Release Branch Creation
```bash
git checkout -b release/v1.6.5 develop
npm run version:bump -- 1.6.5 --notes "..."
git push -u origin release/v1.6.5

### Post-Release Sync
```bash
git checkout develop
git merge origin/main  # Fast-forward
git push origin develop
git push origin --delete release/v1.6.5
```
