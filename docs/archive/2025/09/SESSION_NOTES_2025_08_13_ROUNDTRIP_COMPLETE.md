#### 2.3 Intelligent Review Reports
- **Auto-Approval**: Eligibility assessment with 5-factor criteria
- **Risk Analysis**: Security scoring with confidence metrics
- **Visual Dashboards**: Quality breakdowns and compatibility analysis
- **Reviewer Checklists**: Prioritized tasks with time estimates

### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation ✅

#### Testing Infrastructure
- **E2E Test Suite**: 7-phase comprehensive workflow testing
- **Test Fixtures**: Valid, invalid, and edge case elements
- **Infrastructure Tests**: 12 tests passing (100% success)
- **Manual Testing Guide**: Step-by-step procedures
