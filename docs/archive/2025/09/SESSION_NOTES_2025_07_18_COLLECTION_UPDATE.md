# Session Notes: Collection Update PR #280
Date: July 18, 2025

## Summary
Working on PR #280 to update MCP Server from "marketplace" to "collection" terminology (Issue #59). This is a major refactoring to support the new DollhouseMCP/collection repository structure.

## Current Branch
`fix/update-marketplace-collection-repo`

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Initial Refactoring (Completed)
- ✅ Renamed all persona-specific methods to content-generic:
  - `get_marketplace_persona` → `get_collection_content`
  - `install_persona` → `install_content`  
  - `submit_persona` → `submit_content`
- ✅ Updated all tool names:
  - `browse_marketplace` → `browse_collection`
  - `search_marketplace` → `search_collection`
  - `get_marketplace_content` → `get_collection_content`
- ✅ Renamed folders and files:
  - `src/marketplace/` → `src/collection/`
  - `MarketplaceTools.ts` → `CollectionTools.ts`
  - `MarketplaceBrowser.ts` → `CollectionBrowser.ts`
  - `MarketplaceSearch.ts` → `CollectionSearch.ts`
- ✅ Updated internal variable names for consistency
- ✅ Updated path structure to support: `library/personas/creative/writer.md`

### 2. Critical UX Enhancement (Completed)
- ✅ Updated tool descriptions to explicitly explain that "personas" are a type of content
- ✅ Added natural language examples in descriptions:
  - "download a persona" → maps to `install_content`
  - "find the explain like I'm five persona" → maps to `search_collection`
  - "show me the creative writer persona" → maps to `get_collection_content`
- ✅ This ensures AI assistants correctly interpret when users talk about personas

### 3. PR Review Fixes (Completed)
Fixed all critical issues from Claude's comprehensive review:
- ✅ Fixed 'Invalid marketplace response' → 'Invalid collection response' 
- ✅ Fixed error messages: 'Error browsing/searching marketplace' → 'collection'
- ✅ Fixed tool description: 'submit a persona to the marketplace' → 'collection'
- ✅ Renamed `validateMarketplacePermissions()` → `validateCollectionPermissions()`
- ✅ Fixed 'ready for marketplace submission' → 'collection submission'
- ✅ Updated type definitions: `MarketplacePersona` → `CollectionContent`
- ✅ Renamed `marketplace.ts` → `collection.ts`

### 4. Build Status
- ✅ TypeScript compiles successfully
- ✅ Collection browsing tested and working
- ✅ All critical bugs fixed

## What's Still Needed

### 1. Test Suite Updates
- ⚠️ Test files may still reference old method/tool names
- ⚠️ Integration tests need to be verified with new tool names
- ⚠️ Check `test/__tests__/security/tests/mcp-tools-security.test.ts`

### 2. Documentation Updates
Several docs still reference old tool names:
- `/docs/security/API_WORKFLOW_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `/docs/security/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `/docs/development/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE_2025_07_10.md`
- `/docs/security/SEC-001-IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `/docs/development/SECURITY_SESSION_2025_07_09.md`
- `/docs/project/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`
- `/docs/development/NEXT_SESSION_PRIORITIES.md`

### 3. CI/CD Verification
- ⚠️ Need to ensure all CI tests pass with the new changes
- ⚠️ Security audit is passing but shows Unicode normalization warnings (not critical)

### 4. Additional Testing
- ⚠️ Test actual content installation from collection
- ⚠️ Verify all tool commands work end-to-end
- ⚠️ Test with real Claude Desktop integration

### 5. Potential Future Enhancements (From Review)
- Consider adding backwards compatibility aliases for old tool names
- Add migration guide for users updating from old tool names
- Implement automated checks to prevent old terminology reintroduction

## Key Technical Details

### Breaking Changes
This PR includes breaking changes to MCP tool names:
- Users must update from `browse_marketplace` to `browse_collection`
- Installation commands change from `install_persona` to `install_content`
- Get details commands change from `get_marketplace_persona` to `get_collection_content`

### Repository Structure
The DollhouseMCP/collection repository uses:
```
/library/         # Free community content
  /personas/      # AI behavioral profiles
  /skills/        
  /agents/        
  /prompts/       
  /templates/     
  /tools/         
  /ensembles/     
/showcase/        # Featured content
/catalog/         # Premium content (future)
```

### Important Design Decision
- "Marketplace" → "Collection" everywhere in user-facing text
- "Persona" remains as a specific content type (not genericized)
- TokenManager still uses 'marketplace' as internal scope (not user-facing)

## Current PR Status
- PR #280 is open and has received comprehensive reviews
- All critical bugs have been fixed
- Waiting for CI tests to complete
- Ready for final review once tests pass

## Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Switch to branch
git checkout fix/update-marketplace-collection-repo
