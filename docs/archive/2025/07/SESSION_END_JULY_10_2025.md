- **Rationale**: 
  - Only ~40 downloads on current package
  - Cleaner naming structure
  - Better long-term branding
  - Matches GitHub repository structure

### Installation Path Structure
- Current: `node_modules/@mickdarling/dollhousemcp/`
- Future: `node_modules/@dollhousemcp/mcp-server/`

## For Next Session

### Immediate Tasks
1. Update package.json to `@dollhousemcp/mcp-server`
