# Session Handoff - July 13, 2025 - Post Security Audit & Cleanup

## üéØ Current State Summary

### ‚úÖ Major Accomplishments Today
1. **PR #260 Merged Successfully** - Security audit suppression system working with 0 findings
2. **All Issues Added to DollhouseMCP Roadmap** - ~90+ issues properly tracked
3. **Root Directory Cleanup Complete** - PR #267 created for better organization
4. **Follow-up Issues Created** - 6 new issues (#261-266) for post-merge improvements

### üìç Where We Left Off
- On branch `cleanup-root-directory` 
- Working directory: `/Users/mick/Developer/MCP-Servers/DollhouseMCP/`
- Security audit system fully functional (0 findings)
- Critical security issues identified and prioritized

## üî¥ CRITICAL Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. **#198 - Security Review of Export/Import/Sharing Feature** (CRITICAL)
- **Status**: Needs comprehensive independent security audit
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - handles external URLs and user data
- **Location**: Recently merged PR #197 features
- **Scope**: ReDoS, SSRF, rate limiting, input validation vulnerabilities

### 2. **#202 - GitHub Token Exposure & Over-Privilege** (HIGH)
- **Status**: High priority security issue
- **Problem**: GitHub API tokens lack proper security measures
- **Risk**: Credential compromise and repository access
- **Needs**: Token validation, redaction, scope verification

### 3. **#254 - Implement Audit Logging for Security Operations** (HIGH)
- **Status**: Missing audit trails for security events
- **Impact**: Cannot detect/investigate security breaches
- **Needs**: Comprehensive logging system implementation

### 4. **#262 - Review CodeQL Regex Escaping Warnings** (HIGH)
- **Status**: Just created - CodeQL still flagging regex issues
- **Note**: May be false positive but needs verification
- **Current fix**: `/[\\^$.()+?{}[\]|]/g` pattern in suppressions.ts

### 5. **#263 - Review Overly Broad Unicode Normalization Suppressions** (HIGH)
- **Status**: Just created - some suppressions may hide real vulnerabilities
- **Risk**: Marketplace/persona modules might bypass normalization
- **Needs**: Data flow audit and narrower suppression scope

## üìã Recently Created Follow-up Issues

### Security & Code Quality
- **#261** - Add suppression audit logging for transparency *(Enhancement)*
- **#262** - Review CodeQL regex escaping warnings *(High Priority)*
- **#263** - Review overly broad Unicode normalization suppressions *(High Priority)*
- **#264** - Consolidate dual suppression logic in SecurityAuditor *(Code Quality)*
- **#265** - Add comprehensive tests for suppression system *(High Priority)*
- **#266** - Add error handling for shouldSuppress exceptions *(Robustness)*

## üèóÔ∏è Current Project Structure

### Security Audit System Status
- **Location**: `src/security/audit/config/suppressions.ts`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working perfectly - 0 findings
- **Tests**: 5 regex safety tests + comprehensive suppression tests
- **Key Fix**: Improved path resolution without hard-coded project names

### Active PRs
- **PR #267** - Root directory cleanup (ready to merge)
  - Moved 6 context files to `docs/development/`
  - Moved 2 quick start files to `docs/`
  - Removed 2 temporary files

### Project Management
- **DollhouseMCP Roadmap**: https://github.com/orgs/DollhouseMCP/projects/1
- **All issues added**: ~90+ open issues now tracked in roadmap
- **Critical path**: Focus on security issues #198, #202, #254, #262, #263

## üîß Technical Context

### Security Audit Implementation
```typescript
// Key function that's working correctly:
export function shouldSuppress(ruleId: string, filePath?: string): boolean

// Path resolution improved to work with any project directory name
function getRelativePath(absolutePath: string): string

// Regex escaping pattern (may need CodeQL review):
let pattern = processedGlob.replace(/[\\^$.()+?{}[\]|]/g, '\\$&');
```

### Branch Status
- `main`: Latest with PR #260 merged (security audit suppressions)
- `cleanup-root-directory`: PR #267 ready to merge (housekeeping)
- No other active branches

### Test Status
- All 309 tests passing
- Security audit: 0 findings (down from 172)
- New regex safety tests: 5/5 passing

## üéØ Next Session Immediate Actions

### 1. Start with Critical Security Review (#198)
```bash
# Commands to get oriented:
cd /Users/mick/Developer/MCP-Servers/DollhouseMCP
git checkout main
git pull origin main
gh issue view 198
gh pr view 197  # The merged PR that needs security review
```

### 2. Review CodeQL Warnings (#262)
- Check latest CI run for CodeQL results
- Verify if `/[\\^$.()+?{}[\]|]/g` pattern is sufficient
- May need additional regex patterns or different approach

### 3. Audit Unicode Suppression Scope (#263)
- Review data flow in utility functions
- Check marketplace/persona modules for direct user input
- Consider more granular suppressions vs wildcards

### 4. Consider Merging PR #267
- Low risk organizational cleanup
- Makes project more professional

## üìä Current Security Posture

### ‚úÖ Strengths
- Security audit system working with comprehensive suppressions
- 0 current findings from security audit
- All false positives properly documented
- Robust testing framework in place

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Needing Attention
- Export/import/sharing feature needs independent security audit
- GitHub token handling lacks security measures
- Missing audit logging for security operations
- Some suppressions may be too broad

### üîç Investigation Required
- CodeQL regex warnings (may be false positive)
- Data flow validation for suppressed modules
- Token scope and rotation policies

## üóÇÔ∏è File Locations Reference

### Key Security Files
- `src/security/audit/config/suppressions.ts` - Main suppression config
- `src/security/audit/SecurityAuditor.ts` - Audit engine
- `__tests__/unit/security/audit/suppressions-regex-safety.test.ts` - Safety tests

### Documentation
- `docs/development/` - Context and session notes (now organized)
- `docs/` - User-facing documentation
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project context (main reference)

### Scripts
- `npm run security:audit` - Run security scan
- `scripts/run-security-audit.ts` - Security audit script

## üí° Success Metrics for Next Session

### Critical Security Review (#198)
- [ ] Complete independent audit of export/import/sharing features
- [ ] Document all vulnerabilities found (if any)
- [ ] Create remediation plan with priorities
- [ ] Verify all previous fixes are still effective

### Token Security (#202)
- [ ] Implement TokenManager with validation
- [ ] Add token redaction in logs

## üöÄ Project Goals

**Immediate**: Secure the export/import/sharing feature and fix critical security gaps
**Short-term**: Complete security audit follow-ups and improve observability  
**Medium-term**: Address all high-priority issues in roadmap
