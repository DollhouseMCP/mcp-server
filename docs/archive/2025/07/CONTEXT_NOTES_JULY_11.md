# Context Notes - July 11, 2025

## Key Accomplishments
1. **Export/Import/Sharing Feature** - Fully implemented in ~1 hour
2. **Modular Architecture** - Created clean separation in src/persona/export-import/
3. **5 New MCP Tools** - All integrated and building successfully
4. **6 GitHub Issues** - Created comprehensive tracking (#191-196)

## Important Technical Decisions

### Architecture Pattern
When Mick asked "should we not consolidate different functions in different files rather than putting everything in index.ts?", we immediately:
- Created `src/persona/export-import/` directory
- Split functionality into 3 focused classes
- Kept index.ts methods thin (just delegation)
- This matches the existing pattern in the codebase

### Security Integration
- Reused existing security infrastructure (ContentValidator, SecureYamlParser)
- Static methods required some adjustments but worked well
- Full validation on all imports

### GitHub Gist Sharing
- Implemented with fallback to base64 URLs
- Requires GITHUB_TOKEN for Gist creation
- Private gists for security
- Expiry date checking built in

## Mick's Preferences Observed
1. **Direct action** - "Let's build the import/export/sharing features"
2. **Proper structure** - Immediate positive response to modular architecture
3. **Issue tracking** - "Make sure to make issues for all of these and branches"
4. **Security later** - "I'll push us back into the security stuff" after features

## What Worked Well
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reusing existing security infrastructure
- Comprehensive error handling
- User-friendly output formatting

## Current State
- Feature branch ready but not pushed
- All code committed and building
- No tests written yet
- Ready for manual testing in Claude Desktop

## Remember for Next Time
- Push the branch first thing
- Test in Claude Desktop before writing unit tests
- The PersonaSharer might need adjustments based on GitHub API limits
- Consider adding progress indicators for large exports
