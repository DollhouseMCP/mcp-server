# File Locking Implementation Progress - July 11, 2025

## Current Status
Working on Issue #204: HIGH SECURITY - Race Conditions in Concurrent File Operations

### What's Been Completed âœ…
1. **Created FileLockManager** (`src/security/fileLockManager.ts`)
   - Resource-based locking with automatic cleanup
   - Configurable timeouts to prevent deadlocks
   - Atomic file operations with write-rename pattern
   - Lock queueing for concurrent requests
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Performance metrics tracking

2. **Updated security exports** (`src/security/index.ts`)
   - Added FileLockManager export

3. **Created comprehensive tests** (`__tests__/unit/security/fileLockManager.test.ts`)
   - 10 tests all passing
   - Tests for sequential execution, parallel resources, error handling
   - Timeout testing, metrics tracking, race condition prevention

4. **Started integration into index.ts**
   - Added FileLockManager import
   - Partially integrated into createPersona method
   - Fixed TypeScript syntax errors

### What's In Progress ðŸ”„
1. **Integrating FileLockManager into createPersona**
   - Added file locking wrapper
   - Added atomic write operations
   - Need to test the integration

2. **Need to integrate into editPersona**
   - Started but not completed
   - Lines 1068-1079 need wrapping with FileLockManager.withLock

### What's Pending ðŸ“‹
1. **Complete integration in remaining methods**:
   - loadPersonas (for reading)
   - BackupManager operations
   - Import/Export operations
   - Any other file operations

2. **Integration testing**
   - Test concurrent persona creation
   - Test concurrent edits
   - Test backup during operations

3. **Update BackupManager** to use FileLockManager

## Key Code Patterns

### Using FileLockManager for writes:
```typescript
await FileLockManager.withLock(`persona:${name}`, async () => {
  // Check preconditions
  // Perform atomic write
  await FileLockManager.atomicWriteFile(filePath, content);
});
```

### Using FileLockManager for reads:
```typescript
const content = await FileLockManager.atomicReadFile(filePath);
```

## Current Branch
- Branch: `fix-file-locking-race-conditions`
- Status: Not yet pushed to remote

## Next Steps
1. Complete the editPersona integration
2. Test the createPersona integration
3. Add locking to all other file operations
4. Create integration tests
5. Create PR

## Files Modified
- `/src/security/fileLockManager.ts` - Created
- `/src/security/index.ts` - Updated exports
- `/src/index.ts` - Partially updated (createPersona)
- `/__tests__/unit/security/fileLockManager.test.ts` - Created

## Important Notes
- The FileLockManager is fully functional and tested
- The integration is partially complete
- Need to ensure all file operations use the lock manager
- Consider adding metrics endpoint for monitoring
