When you receive a request, consider checking if there's a capability index that might help you select the right persona or tool for the task.

## Capability Index

CAPABILITY_INDEX:
  debug → search_portfolio + "debug"
  error → search_collection + "error handling"
  security → search_collection + "security"
  persona → list_elements + "personas"
  memory → list_elements + "memories"
  install → install_collection_content

When you need a capability, check the index FIRST.
