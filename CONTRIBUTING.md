## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

We use a GitFlow-inspired branching model:

- **`main`** - Production-ready code (protected)
- **`develop`** - Integration branch for features
- **`feature/*`** - Feature development branches
- **`hotfix/*`** - Emergency fixes to main
- **`release/*`** - Release preparation branches

### 1. Fork and Clone
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcp-server.git
cd mcp-server
git remote add upstream https://github.com/DollhouseMCP/mcp-server.git
```

### 2. Create a Branch
```bash
# For features, branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# For bug fixes to develop
git checkout -b fix/issue-description

# For hotfixes to main (critical issues only)
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue
```

### Branch Naming Conventions
- `feature/` - New features or enhancements
- `fix/` - Bug fixes to develop branch
- `hotfix/` - Emergency fixes to main branch
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test improvements

### 3. Set Up Development Environment
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Start development mode
npm run dev
```

### 4. OAuth Testing Setup

For developers working on OAuth-related features or testing GitHub integration:

#### Creating a Personal Access Token (PAT)
1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/fine-grained)
2. Click "Generate new token" (Fine-grained tokens recommended)
3. Set expiration and select the repository scope
4. Grant the following permissions:
   - **Contents**: Read (for repository access)
   - **Issues**: Write (for issue management)
   - **Pull requests**: Write (for PR management)
   - **Metadata**: Read (required for repository access)

#### Setting Up Your Environment
```bash
# Set your GitHub PAT for testing
export TEST_GITHUB_TOKEN="your_pat_token_here"

# Verify your token works
curl -H "Authorization: token $TEST_GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user
```

#### PAT Testing vs Production OAuth
**Important Differences:**
- **PAT Mode**: Uses your token directly, no user interaction required
- **OAuth Mode**: Uses GitHub's device flow, requires user authorization
- **Testing**: PAT mode is ideal for development and automated testing
- **Production**: OAuth device flow provides better user experience and security

**When to use each:**
- Use PAT mode (`TEST_GITHUB_TOKEN` set) for:
  - Development and debugging
  - Automated testing
  - Quick feature validation
- Use OAuth mode (`TEST_GITHUB_TOKEN` unset) for:
  - Production releases
  - User acceptance testing
  - Demonstrating real user flow

For detailed technical differences, see `docs/development/OAUTH_TESTING_VS_PRODUCTION.md`.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### MCP Server Implementation

- **Transport**: StdioServerTransport (standard I/O for MCP integration)
- **Protocol**: JSON-RPC 2.0 communication
- **Tools**: 41+ MCP tools for element management
- **Entry Point**: `src/index.ts` - Main server class is `DollhouseMCPServer`

### Element System

DollhouseMCP supports six element types:

- **Personas** - AI behavioral profiles
- **Skills** - Discrete capabilities
- **Templates** - Reusable content structures
- **Agents** - Goal-oriented decision makers
- **Memories** - Persistent context storage
- **Ensembles** - Combined element orchestration (under development)

### Portfolio Structure

Elements are stored in `~/.dollhouse/portfolio/`:

```
~/.dollhouse/portfolio/
├── personas/         # Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
├── skills/           # Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
├── templates/        # Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
├── agents/           # Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
├── memories/         # YAML files organized by date
│   ├── 2025-10-08/   # Automatic YYYY-MM-DD folder structure
│   │   └── notes.yaml
│   └── 2025-10-09/
│       └── context.yaml
└── ensembles/        # Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
```

**Note**: Memories use YAML format exclusively and are organized in date-based folders for scalability.

### Data Flow

1. Client Request → MCP Server (StdioServerTransport)
2. Tool Routing → Appropriate handler in DollhouseMCPServer
3. Element Processing → Element-specific manager (PersonaManager, SkillManager, etc.)
4. Storage → PortfolioManager (local files or GitHub sync)
5. Response → Client via JSON-RPC

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests
- Place tests in `__tests__/` directory
- Name test files as `*.test.ts`
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies

### Integration Tests
- Test MCP protocol communication
- Test persona loading and activation
- Test marketplace integration

### ES Module Testing Strategy
Some tests may be temporarily excluded due to Jest's ES module limitations. We follow a "write now, run later" strategy documented in [TESTING_STRATEGY_ES_MODULES.md](./docs/development/TESTING_STRATEGY_ES_MODULES.md). Key points:
- Tests are written even if they can't run due to tooling issues
- Excluded tests are listed in `test/jest.config.cjs` with explanations
- Tests will be re-enabled as Jest's ES module support improves
- This ensures documentation of expected behavior and future-ready test coverage

### Test File Metadata Requirements

When creating **test files for DollhouseMCP** (not user elements), you must include test metadata:

```yaml
---
_dollhouseMCPTest: true
_testMetadata:
  suite: "test-fixtures"        # Choose: test-fixtures, integration-testing, unit-testing
  purpose: "Clear description of test purpose"
  created: "2025-08-20"         # Current date YYYY-MM-DD
  version: "1.0.0"              # Start with 1.0.0
# ... your element metadata ...
---
```

**Template for new test files**:
```markdown
---
_dollhouseMCPTest: true
_testMetadata:
  suite: "test-fixtures"
  purpose: "Test [element type] for [specific behavior] validation"
  created: "2025-08-20"
  version: "1.0.0"
name: "Sample Test Element"
description: "A test element for validating specific functionality"
type: persona  # or skill, template, agent, etc.
---

# Sample Test Element

Your test content here...
```

**Important Notes**:
- ✅ **Only DollhouseMCP test files** need this metadata
- ❌ **User elements should NOT** include `_dollhouseMCPTest: true`
- 🎯 **Write clear purposes**: "Test persona for behavior validation" not "Test file"
- 📖 **See full guide**: [Test Metadata Convention](docs/TEST_METADATA_CONVENTION.md)

### Manual Testing
- Test with your AI platform (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
- Verify personas load correctly
- Check all MCP tools function properly
