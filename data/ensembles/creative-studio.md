### 1. Opening Scene (Mystery/Noir)
```
The rain in Montmartre fell like scattered francs that night, 
each drop catching the gaslight before vanishing into the 
cobblestones. Marie-Claire pulled her cloche hat lower, 
watching the yellow glow from Café des Artistes where 
shadows danced to Django's guitar. She knew he'd be there—
men like Philippe always returned to their habits, like 
pigeons to the same crumb-strewn bench.
```

**English**: "Transform your mornings with coffee that tells a story"

```
Title: "Blockchain Explained Through Baking Bread"

Imagine your grandmother's secret bread recipe. Right now, 
only she knows it. But what if every family member had an 
identical copy that updated automatically whenever she made 
a change? That's blockchain—a recipe book that everyone 
shares and no one can secretly alter.
