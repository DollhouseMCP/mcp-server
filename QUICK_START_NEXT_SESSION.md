# Quick Start Guide - Next Session

## 🎯 PRIORITY: NPM Organization Migration

### Where We Left Off (July 10, 2025, 5:00 PM)
- ✅ Published v1.2.2 to NPM as `@mickdarling/dollhousemcp`
- ✅ Created GitHub release with comprehensive security notes
- ✅ Created NPM organization "DollhouseMCP"
- 🎯 Ready to migrate to `@dollhousemcp/mcp-server`

## 1. Quick Migration Steps
```bash
cd /Users/mick/Developer/MCP-Servers/DollhouseMCP
git pull

# 1. Update package.json
# Change: "name": "@mickdarling/dollhousemcp"
# To:     "name": "@dollhousemcp/mcp-server"
# Also bump version to 1.2.3 or 1.3.0

# 2. Update test
# Edit __tests__/basic.test.ts line 12
# expect(packageJson.name).toBe('@dollhousemcp/mcp-server');

# 3. Run tests
npm test

# 4. Build
npm run build

# 5. Publish to organization
npm publish --access public

# 6. Deprecate old package
npm deprecate @mickdarling/dollhousemcp "Package moved to @dollhousemcp/mcp-server"
```

## 2. Files to Update
- `package.json` - name field
- `README.md` - all NPM installation instructions
- `__tests__/basic.test.ts` - package name test
- Various docs with old package name

## 3. After Migration: Start User Features
```bash
# Update version
npm version 1.2.2

# Create CHANGELOG entry
echo "## [1.2.2] - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

### Security
- Fixed XSS via prompt injection (SEC-001)
- Fixed YAML injection vulnerability (SEC-003)
- Fixed GitHub token exposure (SEC-004)
- Hardened Docker container security (SEC-005)
- Fixed flaky timing tests in CI
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors

### Added
- ContentValidator for prompt injection protection
- SecureYamlParser for safe YAML parsing
- SecureTokenManager for GitHub token security
- SecurityMonitor for centralized logging
- Docker security hardening (non-root, read-only, etc.)
- Deterministic security tests" >> CHANGELOG.md

# Publish
npm publish

# Create release
gh release create v1.2.2 --title "v1.2.2: Security Hardening Release" \
  --notes "Complete security overhaul with enterprise-grade protections"
```

## 4. Context Reminders

### What We Just Did
- Fixed flaky timing test without compromising security
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors blocking CI
- All CI now passing ✅
- Security implementation 100% complete

### What's Important
- Mick wants USER FEATURES (export/import/sharing)
- Security is DONE - time to build features
- v1.2.2 release is top priority
- All 487+ tests passing

### Key Files Changed Today
- `__tests__/unit/InputValidator.test.ts` - Timing test fixes
- Various test files - TypeScript fixes
- Created multiple reference docs in `/docs/development/`

## 5. Quick Decision Tree

**Q: Is v1.2.2 published?**
- No → Do that first (#40)
- Yes → Continue below

**Q: What should I work on?**
1. High-priority security enhancements (#174, #175, #162)
2. User features (export/import/sharing)
3. VS Code extension
4. Documentation

## 6. Useful Commands

```bash
# Run specific tests
npm test -- __tests__/security/

# Check TypeScript compilation
npm run build:test

# View recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Check PR status
gh pr list

# Create new branch
git checkout -b feature/persona-export
```

## 7. Remember
- 🎯 Focus on USER VALUE
- ✅ Security is COMPLETE
- 🚀 Ship v1.2.2 first
- 📝 Document as you go
- 🎉 Celebrate progress!

## 8. Session Goals
1. [ ] Publish v1.2.2 to NPM
2. [ ] Create GitHub release
3. [ ] Start planning export/import features
4. [ ] Make progress on at least one high-priority issue

Good luck! You've got this! 🚀
