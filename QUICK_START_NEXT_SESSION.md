# Quick Start Guide - Next Session

## 1. Check Current State (30 seconds)
```bash
cd /Users/mick/Developer/MCP-Servers/DollhouseMCP
git pull
git status
npm test  # Should show 487+ tests passing
```

## 2. Review Priorities (1 minute)
```bash
# Check high priority issues
gh issue list --label "priority: high"

# Current high priority:
# #40  - NPM publishing (IMMEDIATE!)
# #174 - Rate limiting
# #175 - Async cache refresh  
# #162 - Unicode normalization

# Review master todo list
cat docs/development/MASTER_TODO_LIST_JULY_10_2025.md | head -30
```

## 3. Start v1.2.2 Release (If not done)
```bash
# Update version
npm version 1.2.2

# Create CHANGELOG entry
echo "## [1.2.2] - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

### Security
- Fixed XSS via prompt injection (SEC-001)
- Fixed YAML injection vulnerability (SEC-003)
- Fixed GitHub token exposure (SEC-004)
- Hardened Docker container security (SEC-005)
- Fixed flaky timing tests in CI
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors

### Added
- ContentValidator for prompt injection protection
- SecureYamlParser for safe YAML parsing
- SecureTokenManager for GitHub token security
- SecurityMonitor for centralized logging
- Docker security hardening (non-root, read-only, etc.)
- Deterministic security tests" >> CHANGELOG.md

# Publish
npm publish

# Create release
gh release create v1.2.2 --title "v1.2.2: Security Hardening Release" \
  --notes "Complete security overhaul with enterprise-grade protections"
```

## 4. Context Reminders

### What We Just Did
- Fixed flaky timing test without compromising security
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors blocking CI
- All CI now passing ✅
- Security implementation 100% complete

### What's Important
- Mick wants USER FEATURES (export/import/sharing)
- Security is DONE - time to build features
- v1.2.2 release is top priority
- All 487+ tests passing

### Key Files Changed Today
- `__tests__/unit/InputValidator.test.ts` - Timing test fixes
- Various test files - TypeScript fixes
- Created multiple reference docs in `/docs/development/`

## 5. Quick Decision Tree

**Q: Is v1.2.2 published?**
- No → Do that first (#40)
- Yes → Continue below

**Q: What should I work on?**
1. High-priority security enhancements (#174, #175, #162)
2. User features (export/import/sharing)
3. VS Code extension
4. Documentation

## 6. Useful Commands

```bash
# Run specific tests
npm test -- __tests__/security/

# Check TypeScript compilation
npm run build:test

# View recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Check PR status
gh pr list

# Create new branch
git checkout -b feature/persona-export
```

## 7. Remember
