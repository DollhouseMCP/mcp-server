# DollhouseMCP™ Commercial License

> **Important Legal Notice**: This document describes our commercial licensing program but does not itself constitute a binding commercial license. Commercial licenses require a separate written agreement negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Until such an agreement is executed, all use of DollhouseMCP is governed exclusively by AGPL-3.0 terms as stated in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file.

## Dual Licensing Overview

DollhouseMCP is available under two licensing options:

1. **AGPL-3.0** (Open Source) - Free for personal, educational, and open source projects
2. **Commercial License** - For proprietary/commercial use without AGPL obligations

## Who Needs a Commercial License?

You need a commercial license if you want to:

- Use DollhouseMCP in a proprietary application without releasing your source code
- Integrate DollhouseMCP into a commercial product or service
- Avoid AGPL-3.0's copyleft requirements
- Use DollhouseMCP in a closed-source SaaS application
- Distribute DollhouseMCP as part of proprietary software

## AGPL-3.0 Requirements (Open Source License)

Under AGPL-3.0, you must:

- Make your complete source code available to users
- License your entire application under AGPL-3.0
- Provide source code even for network/SaaS use
- Include copyright and license notices

**If these requirements don't work for your use case, you need a commercial license.**

## Commercial License Benefits

- ✅ No requirement to open source your code
- ✅ No copyleft obligations
- ✅ Use in proprietary/closed-source applications
- ✅ Distribute without AGPL restrictions
- ✅ Priority support options available
- ✅ Legal indemnification (subject to terms)

## Pricing & Terms

Commercial licenses are negotiated on a case-by-case basis depending on:

- **Company size and revenue** - Enterprise vs startup considerations
- **Use case** - Internal use vs redistribution/resale
- **Scale** - Number of deployments, users, or installations
- **Support requirements** - Self-supported vs priority support tiers
- **Distribution model** - Embedded in your product vs standalone use

### Pricing Factors

**Internal Use**: Lower licensing fees for companies using DollhouseMCP internally without redistribution. Pricing scales with company size and deployment scope.

**Redistribution/Resale**: Higher licensing fees apply when DollhouseMCP is embedded in or distributed with commercial products, especially for OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), ISV (Independent Software Vendor), or resale scenarios.

**Current Model**: As an emerging open source project, we do not publish fixed pricing tiers. Each commercial license is individually negotiated to ensure fair pricing appropriate to your specific use case and scale. This flexibility benefits both startups with limited budgets and enterprises with complex deployment needs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I evaluate DollhouseMCP before purchasing a commercial license?

A: Yes! You can evaluate under AGPL-3.0 for testing and proof-of-concept work. Commercial license is only required when you deploy to production or distribute.

### Q: What if I'm a startup or small business?

A: We offer flexible pricing for startups and small businesses. Contact us to discuss options.

### Q: Can I use DollhouseMCP for internal tools without a commercial license?

A: If you're comfortable with AGPL-3.0's terms (making your internal tool's source code available to users who access it over a network), then you can use AGPL-3.0. Otherwise, contact us for a commercial license.

### Q: What about open source projects?

A: Open source projects under OSI-approved licenses can use AGPL-3.0 for free. No commercial license needed!

### Q: Can I contribute to DollhouseMCP and still use the commercial license?

A: Yes! Contributing and commercial licensing are separate. You can contribute to the project and also purchase a commercial license if needed for your proprietary use.

### Q: How do contributions work with dual licensing?

A: By contributing to DollhouseMCP, you grant DollhouseMCP a license to distribute your contribution under both AGPL-3.0 and commercial licenses. **You retain copyright** to your contributions, but grant us the rights needed to offer dual licensing. This is standard practice in dual-licensed projects like Qt and MySQL.

**Key points**:
- Contributors retain copyright ownership
- Contributors grant DollhouseMCP rights to distribute under AGPL-3.0
- Contributors grant DollhouseMCP rights to include in commercial licenses
- Your contribution remains open source under AGPL-3.0
- This enables the project to fund continued development through commercial licensing

If you're concerned about these terms, please discuss before contributing.

### Q: What indemnification is provided?

A: **AGPL-3.0 Users**: The software is provided "AS IS" with no warranty or indemnification of any kind.

**Commercial License Customers**: Commercial licenses include negotiated indemnification provisions protecting both parties. Specific terms (including indemnification scope, caps, and exclusions) are determined on a case-by-case basis depending on your use case and risk profile. Contact us to discuss your specific indemnification requirements.
