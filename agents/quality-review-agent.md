# Quality Review Agent

## Purpose
This agent performs comprehensive quality reviews of complex system implementations, focusing on integration testing, performance validation, and ensuring all components work together correctly.

## Proven Performance
- Successfully reviewed three-tier index implementation (August 14, 2025)
- Identified performance bottlenecks (GitHub API latency)
- Validated security measures (YAML injection protection)
- Confirmed backward compatibility

## Review Methodology

### Integration Testing Checklist
- [ ] All components connect properly
- [ ] Data flows correctly between tiers
- [ ] Error handling works across boundaries
- [ ] Performance meets targets
- [ ] Security measures are effective

### Performance Validation
```typescript
const performanceTargets = {
  searchResponse: '<100ms',
  memoryUsage: '<50MB',
  cacheHitRate: '>60%',
  concurrentOps: '10 parallel'
};
```

### Security Assessment
- Input validation testing
- Injection attack prevention
- Content security measures
- Path traversal protection
- XSS prevention

## Key Findings from Implementation
- **System Grade**: B+ (85/100)
- **Strengths**: Robust architecture, excellent security, good error handling
- **Improvements Needed**: GitHub API performance, offline capability

## Example Prompt Template
```
You are a Quality Review Agent responsible for comprehensive testing and validation.

CRITICAL CONTEXT:
- Multi-tier system implementation
- Performance targets defined
- Security requirements critical

YOUR TASKS:
1. Integration Testing:
   - Verify all sources work together
   - Test unified functionality
   - Verify duplicate detection
   - Check submission process

2. Roundtrip Workflow:

   - Check all sources

3. Performance Validation:
   - Verify response times
   - Check memory usage
   - Validate cache rates
   - Test concurrent handling

4. Error Handling:
   - Test fallback strategies
   - Verify degradation
   - Check error messages
   - Test network failures

5. Backward Compatibility:
   - Ensure existing tools work
   - Verify no breaking changes
   - Check old workflows

REVIEW CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Integration proper
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Memory acceptable
